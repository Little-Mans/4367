<center><h3>BATTLE OF SPOTTSYLVANIA&mdash;HANCOCK'S POSITION&mdash;ASSAULT OF WARREN'S
AND WRIGHT'S CORPS&mdash;UPTON PROMOTED ON THE FIELD&mdash;GOOD NEWS FROM
BUTLER AND SHERIDAN.</h3></center>
<br>

<p>The Mattapony River is formed by the junction of the Mat, the
Ta, the Po and the Ny rivers, the last being the northernmost of
the four.  It takes its rise about a mile south and a little east
of the Wilderness Tavern.  The Po rises south-west of the place,
but farther away.  Spottsylvania is on the ridge dividing these
two streams, and where they are but a few miles apart.  The
Brock Road reaches Spottsylvania without crossing either of
these streams. Lee's army coming up by the Catharpin Road, had
to cross the Po at Wooden Bridge.  Warren and Hancock came by
the Brock Road.  Sedgwick crossed the Ny at Catharpin Furnace.
Burnside coming by Aldrich's to Gates's house, had to cross the
Ny near the enemy.  He found pickets at the bridge, but they
were soon driven off by a brigade of Willcox's division, and the
stream was crossed.  This brigade was furiously attacked; but the
remainder of the division coming up, they were enabled to hold
their position, and soon fortified it.</p>

<p>About the time I received the news of this attack, word came
from Hancock that Early had left his front.  He had been forced
over to the Catharpin Road, crossing the Po at Corbin's and
again at Wooden Bridge.  These are the bridges Sheridan had
given orders to his cavalry to occupy on the 8th, while one
division should occupy Spottsylvania.  These movements of the
enemy gave me the idea that Lee was about to make the attempt to
get to, or towards, Fredericksburg to cut off my supplies.  I
made arrangements to attack his right and get between him and
Richmond if he should try to execute this design.  If he had any
such intention it was abandoned as soon as Burnside was
established south of the Ny.</p>

<p>The Po and the Ny are narrow little streams, but deep, with
abrupt banks, and bordered by heavily wooded and marshy
bottoms&mdash;at the time we were there&mdash;and difficult to cross
except where bridged.  The country about was generally heavily
timbered, but with occasional clearings.  It was a much better
country to conduct a defensive campaign in than an offensive one.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<br><br>

<p>By noon of the 9th the position of the two armies was as
follows:  Lee occupied a semicircle facing north, north-west and
north-east, inclosing the town.  Anderson was on his left
extending to the Po, Ewell came next, then Early.  Warren
occupied our right, covering the Brock and other roads
converging at Spottsylvania; Sedgwick was to his left and
Burnside on our extreme left.  Hancock was yet back at Todd's
Tavern, but as soon as it was known that Early had left
Hancock's front the latter was ordered up to Warren's right.  He
formed a line with three divisions on the hill overlooking the Po
early in the afternoon, and was ordered to cross the Po and get
on the enemy's flank.  The fourth division of Hancock's corps,
Mott commanding, was left at Todd's when the corps first came
up; but in the afternoon it was brought up and placed to the
left of Sedgwick's&mdash;now Wright's&mdash;6th corps.  In the morning
General Sedgwick had been killed near the right of his
intrenchments by rebel sharpshooters.  His loss was a severe one
to the Army of the Potomac and to the Nation.  General H. G.
Wright succeeded him in the command of his corps.</p>

<p>Hancock was now, nine P.M. of the 9th of May, across the left
flank of Lee's army, but separated from it, and also from the
remainder of Meade's army, by the Po River.  But for the
lateness of the hour and the darkness of the night he would
have attempted to cross the river again at Wooden Bridge, thus
bringing himself on the same side with both friend and foe.</p>

<p>The Po at the points where Hancock's corps crossed runs nearly
due east. Just below his lower crossing&mdash;the troops crossed at
three points&mdash;it turns due south, and after passing under Wooden
Bridge soon resumes a more easterly direction.  During the night
this corps built three bridges over the Po; but these were in
rear.</p>

<p>The position assumed by Hancock's corps forced Lee to reinforce
his left during the night.  Accordingly on the morning of the
10th, when Hancock renewed his effort to get over the Po to his
front, he found himself confronted by some of Early's command,
which had been brought from the extreme right of the enemy
during the night.  He succeeded in effecting a crossing with one
brigade, however, but finding the enemy intrenched in his front,
no more were crossed.</p>

<p>Hancock reconnoitred his front on the morning of the 10th, with
the view of forcing a crossing, if it was found that an
advantage could be gained.  The enemy was found strongly
intrenched on the high ground overlooking the river, and
commanding the Wooden Bridge with artillery.  Anderson's left
rested on the Po, where it turns south; therefore, for Hancock
to cross over&mdash;although it would bring him to the same side of
the stream with the rest of the army&mdash;would still farther
isolate him from it.  The stream would have to be crossed twice
in the face of the enemy to unite with the main body.  The idea
of crossing was therefore abandoned.</p>

<p>Lee had weakened the other parts of his line to meet this
movement of Hancock's, and I determined to take advantage of
it.  Accordingly in the morning, orders were issued for an
attack in the afternoon on the centre by Warren's and Wright's
corps, Hancock to command all the attacking force.  Two of his
divisions were brought to the north side of the Po.  Gibbon was
placed to the right of Warren, and Birney in his rear as a
reserve.  Barlow's division was left south of the stream, and
Mott of the same corps was still to the left of Wright's
corps.  Burnside was ordered to reconnoitre his front in force,
and, if an opportunity presented, to attack with vigor.  The
enemy seeing Barlow's division isolated from the rest of the
army, came out and attacked with fury.  Barlow repulsed the
assault with great slaughter, and with considerable loss to
himself.  But the enemy reorganized and renewed the assault.
Birney was now moved to the high ground overlooking the river
crossings built by our troops, and covered the crossings.  The
second assault was repulsed, again with severe loss to the
enemy, and Barlow was withdrawn without further molestation.
General T. G. Stevenson was killed in this move.</p>

<p>Between the lines, where Warren's assault was to take place,
there was a ravine grown up with large trees and underbrush,
making it almost impenetrable by man.  The slopes on both sides
were also covered with a heavy growth of timber.  Warren, before
noon, reconnoitred his front twice, the first time with one and
the second with two divisions.  He was repulsed on both
occasions, but gained such information of the ground as to
induce him to report recommending the assault.</p>

<p>Wright also reconnoitred his front and gained a considerably
advanced position from the one he started from.  He then
organized a storming party, consisting of twelve regiments, and
assigned Colonel Emory Upton, of the 121st New York Volunteers,
to the command of it.  About four o'clock in the afternoon the
assault was ordered, Warren's and Wright's corps, with Mott's
division of Hancock's corps, to move simultaneously.  The
movement was prompt, and in a few minutes the fiercest of
struggles began.  The battle-field was so densely covered with
forest that but little could be seen, by any one person, as to
the progress made.  Meade and I occupied the best position we
could get, in rear of Warren.</p>

<p>Warren was repulsed with heavy loss, General J. C. Rice being
among the killed.  He was not followed, however, by the enemy,
and was thereby enabled to reorganize his command as soon as
covered from the guns of the enemy.  To the left our success was
decided, but the advantage was lost by the feeble action of
Mott.  Upton with his assaulting party pushed forward and
crossed the enemy's intrenchments.  Turning to the right and
left he captured several guns and some hundreds of prisoners.
Mott was ordered to his assistance but failed utterly.  So much
time was lost in trying to get up the troops which were in the
right position to reinforce, that I ordered Upton to withdraw;
but the officers and men of his command were so averse to giving
up the advantage they had gained that I withdrew the order.  To
relieve them, I ordered a renewal of the assault.  By this time
Hancock, who had gone with Birney's division to relieve Barlow,
had returned, bringing the division with him.  His corps was now
joined with Warren's and Wright's in this last assault.  It was
gallantly made, many men getting up to, and over, the works of
the enemy; but they were not able to hold them.  At night they
were withdrawn.  Upton brought his prisoners with him, but the
guns he had captured he was obliged to abandon.  Upton had
gained an important advantage, but a lack in others of the
spirit and dash possessed by him lost it to us.  Before leaving
Washington I had been authorized to promote officers on the
field for special acts of gallantry.  By this authority I
conferred the rank of brigadier-general upon Upton on the spot,
and this act was confirmed by the President.  Upton had been
badly wounded in this fight.</p>

<p>Burnside on the left had got up to within a few hundred yards of
Spottsylvania Court House, completely turning Lee's right.  He
was not aware of the importance of the advantage he had gained,
and I, being with the troops where the heavy fighting was, did
not know of it at the time.  He had gained his position with but
little fighting, and almost without loss.  Burnside's position
now separated him widely from Wright's corps, the corps nearest
to him.  At night he was ordered to join on to this.  This
brought him back about a mile, and lost to us an important
advantage.  I attach no blame to Burnside for this, but I do to
myself for not having had a staff officer with him to report to
me his position.</p>

<p>The enemy had not dared to come out of his line at any point to
follow up his advantage, except in the single instance of his
attack on Barlow.  Then he was twice repulsed with heavy loss,
though he had an entire corps against two brigades.  Barlow took
up his bridges in the presence of this force.</p>

<p>On the 11th there was no battle and but little firing; none
except by Mott who made a reconnoissance to ascertain if there
was a weak point in the enemy's line.</p>

<p>I wrote the following letter to General Halleck:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
<br>NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H.,
<br>May 11, 1864&mdash;8.30 A.M.</p>

<p>MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Chief of Staff of the Army,
<br>Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>We have now ended the 6th day of very hard fighting.  The result
up to this time is much in our favor.  But our losses have been
heavy as well as those of the enemy.  We have lost to this time
eleven general officers killed, wounded and missing, and
probably twenty thousand men.  I think the loss of the enemy
must be greater&mdash;we having taken over four thousand prisoners in
battle, whilst he has taken from us but few except a few
stragglers.  I am now sending back to Belle Plain all my wagons
for a fresh supply of provisions and ammunition, and purpose to
fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.</p>

<p>The arrival of reinforcements here will be very encouraging to
the men, and I hope they will be sent as fast as possible, and
in as great numbers.  My object in having them sent to Belle
Plain was to use them as an escort to our supply trains.  If it
is more convenient to send them out by train to march from the
railroad to Belle Plain or Fredericksburg, send them so.</p>

<p>I am satisfied the enemy are very shaky, and are only kept up to
the mark by the greatest exertions on the part of their officers,
and by keeping them intrenched in every position they take.</p>

<p>Up to this time there is no indication of any portion of Lee's
army being detached for the defence of Richmond.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
And also, I received information, through the War Department,
from General Butler that his cavalry under Kautz had cut the
railroad south of Petersburg, separating Beauregard from
Richmond, and had whipped Hill, killing, wounding and capturing
many.  Also that he was intrenched, and could maintain
himself.  On this same day came news from Sheridan to the effect
that he had destroyed ten miles of the railroad and telegraph
between Lee and Richmond, one and a half million rations, and
most of the medical stores for his army.</p>

<p>On the 8th I had directed Sheridan verbally to cut loose from
the Army of the Potomac and pass around the left of Lee's army
and attack his cavalry and communications, which was
successfully executed in the manner I have already described.</p>



<br><br><br><br>
<a name="ch53"></a><center><h2>CHAPTER LIII.</h2></center>

<center><h3>HANCOCK'S ASSAULT&mdash;LOSSES OF THE CONFEDERATES&mdash;PROMOTIONS
RECOMMENDED&mdash;DISCOMFITURE OF THE ENEMY&mdash;EWELL'S ATTACK&mdash;REDUCING
THE ARTILLERY.</h3></center>
<br>

<p>In the reconnoissance made by Mott on the 11th, a salient was
discovered at the right centre. I determined that an assault
should be made at that point. Accordingly in the afternoon
Hancock was ordered to move his command by the rear of Warren and
Wright, under cover of night, to Wright's left, and there form it
for an assault at four o'clock the next morning.  The night was
dark, it rained heavily, and the road was difficult, so that it
was midnight when he reached the point where he was to halt.  It
took most of the night to get the men in position for their
advance in the morning.  The men got but little rest.  Burnside
was ordered to attack on the left of the salient at the
same hour.  I sent two of my staff officers to impress upon him
the importance of pushing forward vigorously.  Hancock was
notified of this.  Warren and Wright were ordered to hold
themselves in readiness to join in the assault if circumstances
made it advisable.  I occupied a central position most
convenient for receiving information from all points.  Hancock
put Barlow on his left, in double column, and Birney to his
right.  Mott followed Birney, and Gibbon was held in reserve.</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<br>HEADQUARTERS ARMIES U. S.,
<br>May 11, 1864.&mdash;3 P.M.

<br><br>MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,
<br>Commanding Army of the Potomac.

<br><br>Move three divisions of the 2d corps by the rear of the 5th and
6th corps, under cover of night, so as to join the 9th corps in
a vigorous assault on the enemy at four o'clock A.M. to-morrow.
will send one or two staff officers over to-night to stay with
Burnside, and impress him with the importance of a prompt and
vigorous attack.  Warren and Wright should hold their corps as
close to the enemy as possible, to take advantage of any
diversion caused by this attack, and to push in if any
opportunity presents itself.  There is but little doubt in my
mind that the assault last evening would have proved entirely
successful if it had commenced one hour earlier and had been
heartily entered into by Mott's division and the 9th corps.

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.

<br><br><br>

<br>HEADQUARTERS, ARMIES U. S.,
<br>May 11, 1864.-4 P.M.

<br><br>MAJOR-GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE,
<br>Commanding 9th Army Corps.

<br><br>Major-General Hancock has been ordered to move his corps under
cover of night to join you in a vigorous attack against the
enemy at 4 o'clock A.M. to-morrow.  You will move against the
enemy with your entire force promptly and with all possible
vigor at precisely 4 o'clock A.M. to-morrow the 12th inst.  Let
your preparations for this attack be conducted with the utmost
secrecy and veiled entirely from the enemy.

<br><br>I send two of my staff officers, Colonels Comstock and Babcock,
in whom I have great confidence and who are acquainted with the
direction the attack is to be made from here, to remain with you
and General Hancock with instructions to render you every
assistance in their power.  Generals Warren and Wright will hold
their corps as close to the enemy as possible, to take advantage
of any diversion caused by yours and Hancock's attack, and will
push in their whole force if any opportunity presents itself.

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.

</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>The morning of the 12th opened foggy, delaying the start more
than half an hour.</p>

<p>The ground over which Hancock had to pass to reach the enemy,
was ascending and heavily wooded to within two or three hundred
yards of the enemy's intrenchments.  In front of Birney there
was also a marsh to cross.  But, notwithstanding all these
difficulties, the troops pushed on in quick time without firing
a gun, and when within four or five hundred yards of the enemy's
line broke out in loud cheers, and with a rush went up to and
over the breastworks.  Barlow and Birney entered almost
simultaneously.  Here a desperate hand-to-hand conflict took
place.  The men of the two sides were too close together to
fire, but used their guns as clubs.  The hand conflict was soon
over.  Hancock's corps captured some four thousand prisoners
among them a division and a brigade commander twenty or more
guns with their horses, caissons, and ammunition, several
thousand stand of arms, and many colors.  Hancock, as soon as
the hand-to-hand conflict was over, turned the guns of the enemy
against him and advanced inside the rebel lines.  About six
o'clock I ordered Warren's corps to the support of Hancock's.
Burnside, on the left, had advanced up east of the salient to
the very parapet of the enemy.  Potter, commanding one of his
divisions, got over but was not able to remain there.  However,
he inflicted a heavy loss upon the enemy; but not without loss
in return.</p>

<p>This victory was important, and one that Lee could not afford to
leave us in full possession of.  He made the most strenuous
efforts to regain the position he had lost.  Troops were brought
up from his left and attacked Hancock furiously.  Hancock was
forced to fall back:  but he did so slowly, with his face to the
enemy, inflicting on him heavy loss, until behind the breastworks
he had captured.  These he turned, facing them the other way, and
continued to hold.  Wright was ordered up to reinforce Hancock,
and arrived by six o'clock.  He was wounded soon after coming up
but did not relinquish the command of his corps, although the
fighting lasted until one o'clock the next morning.  At eight
o'clock Warren was ordered up again, but was so slow in making
his dispositions that his orders were frequently repeated, and
with emphasis.  At eleven o'clock I gave Meade written orders to
relieve Warren from his command if he failed to move promptly.
Hancock placed batteries on high ground in his rear, which he
used against the enemy, firing over the heads of his own troops.</p>

<p>Burnside accomplished but little on our left of a positive
nature, but negatively a great deal.  He kept Lee from
reinforcing his centre from that quarter.  If the 5th corps, or
rather if Warren, had been as prompt as Wright was with the 6th
corps, better results might have been obtained.</p>

<p>Lee massed heavily from his left flank on the broken point of
his line.  Five times during the day he assaulted furiously, but
without dislodging our troops from their new position.  His
losses must have been fearful.  Sometimes the belligerents would
be separated by but a few feet.  In one place a tree, eighteen
inches in diameter, was cut entirely down by musket balls.  All
the trees between the lines were very much cut to pieces by
artillery and musketry.  It was three o'clock next morning
before the fighting ceased.  Some of our troops had then been
twenty hours under fire.  In this engagement we did not lose a
single organization, not even a company.  The enemy lost one
division with its commander, one brigade and one regiment, with
heavy losses elsewhere.  Our losses were heavy, but, as
stated, no whole company was captured.  At night Lee took a
position in rear of his former one, and by the following morning
he was strongly intrenched in it.</p>

<br><br>The eighth day of the battle closes, leaving between three and
four thousand prisoners in our hands for the day's work,
including two general officers, and over thirty pieces of
artillery.  The enemy are obstinate, and seem to have found the
last ditch.  We have lost no organizations, not even that of a
company, whilst we have destroyed and captured one division
(Johnson's), one brigade (Doles'), and one regiment entire from
the enemy.

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Warren's corps was now temporarily broken up, Cutler's division
sent to Wright, and Griffin's to Hancock.  Meade ordered his
chief of staff, General Humphreys, to remain with Warren and the
remaining division, and authorized him to give it orders in his
name.</p>

<p>During the day I was passing along the line from wing to wing
continuously.  About the centre stood a house which proved to be
occupied by an old lady and her daughter.  She showed such
unmistakable signs of being strongly Union that I stopped.  She
said she had not seen a Union flag for so long a time that it
did her heart good to look upon it again.  She said her husband
and son, being, Union men, had had to leave early in the war,
and were now somewhere in the Union army, if alive.  She was
without food or nearly so, so I ordered rations issued to her,
and promised to find out if I could where the husband and son
were.</p>

<p>There was no fighting on the 13th, further than a little
skirmishing between Mott's division and the enemy.  I was afraid
that Lee might be moving out, and I did not want him to go
without my knowing it. The indications were that he was moving,
but it was found that he was only taking his new position back
from the salient that had been captured.  Our dead were buried
this day.  Mott's division was reduced to a brigade, and
assigned to Birney's division.</p>

<p>During this day I wrote to Washington recommending Sherman and
Meade for promotion to the grade of Major-General in the
regular army; Hancock for Brigadier-General; Wright, Gibbon and
Humphreys to be Major-Generals of Volunteers; and Upton and
Carroll to be Brigadiers.  Upton had already been named as such,
but the appointment had to be confirmed by the Senate on the
nomination of the President.</p>

<br>Washington, D. C.

<br><br>I beg leave to recommend the following promotions be made for
gallant and distinguished services in the last eight days'
battles, to wit:  Brigadier-General H. G. Wright and
Brigadier-General John Gibbon to be Major-Generals; Colonel S.
S. Carroll, 8th Ohio Volunteers Colonel E. Upton, 121st New York
Volunteers; Colonel William McCandless, 2d Pennsylvania Reserves,
to be Brigadier-Generals. I would also recommend Major-General W.
S. Hancock for Brigadier-General in the regular army.  His
services and qualifications are eminently deserving of this
recognition.  In making these recommendations I do not wish the
claims of General G. M. Dodge for promotion forgotten, but
recommend his name to be sent in at the same time.  I would also
ask to have General Wright assigned to the command of the Sixth
Army Corps.  I would further ask the confirmation of General
Humphreys to the rank of Major-General.

<br><br>General Meade has more than met my most sanguine expectations.
He and Sherman are the fittest officers for large commands I
have come in contact with.  If their services can be rewarded by
promotion to the rank of Major-Generals in the regular army the
honor would be worthily bestowed, and I would feel personally
gratified.  I would not like to see one of these promotions at
this time without seeing both.

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.

<p>The night of the 13th Warren and Wright were moved by the rear
to the left of Burnside.  The night was very dark and it rained
heavily, the roads were so bad that the troops had to cut trees
and corduroy the road a part of the way, to get through.  It was
midnight before they got to the point where they were to halt,
and daylight before the troops could be organized to advance to
their position in line.  They gained their position in line,
however, without any fighting, except a little in Wright's
front.  Here Upton had to contend for an elevation which we
wanted and which the enemy was not disposed to yield.  Upton
first drove the enemy, and was then repulsed in turn.  Ayres
coming to his support with his brigade (of Griffin's division,
Warren's corps), the position was secured and fortified.  There
was no more battle during the 14th.  This brought our line east
of the Court House and running north and south and facing west.</p>

<p>During the night of the 14th-15th Lee moved to cover this new
front.  This left Hancock without an enemy confronting him.  He
was brought to the rear of our new centre, ready to be moved in
any direction he might be wanted.</p>

<p>On the 15th news came from Butler and Averill.  The former
reported the capture of the outer works at Drury's Bluff, on the
James River, and that his cavalry had cut the railroad and
telegraph south of Richmond on the Danville road:  and the
latter, the destruction of a depot of supplies at Dublin, West
Virginia, and the breaking of New River Bridge on the Virginia
and Tennessee Railroad.  The next day news came from Sherman and
Sheridan.  Sherman had forced Johnston out of Dalton, Georgia,
and was following him south.  The report from Sheridan embraced
his operations up to his passing the outer defences of
Richmond.  The prospect must now have been dismal in Richmond.
The road and telegraph were cut between the capital and Lee. The
roads and wires were cut in every direction from the rebel
capital.  Temporarily that city was cut off from all
communication with the outside except by courier.  This
condition of affairs, however, was of but short duration.</p>

<p>I wrote Halleck:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
<br>NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H.,
<br>May 16, 1864, 8 A.M.</p>

<p>MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK,
<br>Washington, D. C.:</p>

<p>We have had five days almost constant rain without any prospect
yet of it clearing up.  The roads have now become so impassable
that ambulances with wounded men can no longer run between here
and Fredericksburg.  All offensive operations necessarily cease
until we can have twenty-four hours of dry weather.  The army is
in the best of spirits, and feel the greatest confidence of
ultimate success.
<br><br> ***************************************
<br>You can assure the President and Secretary of War that the elements
alone have suspended hostilities, and that it is in no manner
due to weakness or exhaustion on our part.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
The condition of the roads was such that nothing was done on the
17th.  But that night Hancock and Wright were to make a night
march back to their old positions, and to make an assault at
four o'clock in the morning.  Lee got troops back in time to
protect his old line, so the assault was unsuccessful.  On this
day (18th) the news was almost as discouraging to us as it had
been two days before in the rebel capital.  As stated above,
Hancock's and Wright's corps had made an unsuccessful assault.
News came that Sigel had been defeated at New Market, badly, and
was retreating down the valley.  Not two hours before, I had sent
the inquiry to Halleck whether Sigel could not get to Staunton to
stop supplies coming from there to Lee.  I asked at once that
Sigel might be relieved, and some one else put in his place.
Hunter's name was suggested, and I heartily approved.  Further
news from Butler reported him driven from Drury's Bluff, but
still in possession of the Petersburg road.  Banks had been
defeated in Louisiana, relieved, and Canby put in his place.
This change of commander was not on my suggestion.  All this
news was very discouraging.  All of it must have been known by
the enemy before it was by me.  In fact, the good news (for the
enemy) must have been known to him at the moment I thought he
was in despair, and his anguish had been already relieved when
we were enjoying his supposed discomfiture, But this was no time
for repining.  I immediately gave orders for a movement by the
left flank, on towards Richmond, to commence on the night of the
19th.  I also asked Halleck to secure the cooperation of the navy
in changing our base of supplies from Fredericksburg to Port
Royal, on the Rappahannock.</p>

<p>Up to this time I had received no reinforcements, except six
thousand raw troops under Brigadier General Robert O. Tyler,
just arrived.  They had not yet joined their command, Hancock's
corps, but were on our right.  This corps had been brought to
the rear of the centre, ready to move in any direction.  Lee,
probably suspecting some move on my part, and seeing our right
entirely abandoned, moved Ewell's corps about five o'clock in
the afternoon, with Early's as a reserve, to attack us in that
quarter.  Tyler had come up from Fredericksburg, and had been
halted on the road to the right of our line, near Kitching's
brigade of Warren's corps.  Tyler received the attack with his
raw troops, and they maintained their position, until
reinforced, in a manner worthy of veterans.</p>

<p>Hancock was in a position to reinforce speedily, and was the
soldier to do it without waiting to make dispositions.  Birney
was thrown to Tyler's right and Crawford to his left, with
Gibbon as a reserve; and Ewell was whirled back speedily and
with heavy loss.</p>

<p>Warren had been ordered to get on Ewell's flank and in his rear,
to cut him off from his intrenchments.  But his efforts were so
feeble that under the cover of night Ewell got back with only
the loss of a few hundred prisoners, besides his killed and
wounded.  The army being engaged until after dark, I rescinded
the order for the march by our left flank that night.</p>

<p>As soon as it was discovered that the enemy were coming out to
attack, I naturally supposed they would detach a force to
destroy our trains.  The withdrawal of Hancock from the right
uncovered one road from Spottsylvania to Fredericksburg over
which trains drew our supplies.  This was guarded by a division
of colored troops, commanded by General Ferrero, belonging to
Burnside's corps.  Ferrero was therefore promptly notified, and
ordered to throw his cavalry pickets out to the south and be
prepared to meet the enemy if he should come; if he had to
retreat to do so towards Fredericksburg.  The enemy did detach
as expected, and captured twenty-five or thirty wagons which,
however, were soon retaken.</p>

<p>In consequence of the disasters that had befallen us in the past
few days, Lee could be reinforced largely, and I had no doubt he
would be.  Beauregard had come up from the south with troops to
guard the Confederate capital when it was in danger.  Butler
being driven back, most of the troops could be sent to Lee. Hoke
was no longer needed in North Carolina; and Sigel's troops having
gone back to Cedar Creek, whipped, many troops could be spared
from the valley.</p>

<p>The Wilderness and Spottsylvania battles convinced me that we
had more artillery than could ever be brought into action at any
one time.  It occupied much of the road in marching, and taxed
the trains in bringing up forage.  Artillery is very useful when
it can be brought into action, but it is a very burdensome luxury
where it cannot be used.  Before leaving Spottsylvania,
therefore, I sent back to the defences of Washington over one
hundred pieces of artillery, with the horses and caissons.  This
relieved the roads over which we were to march of more than two
hundred six-horse teams, and still left us more artillery than
could be advantageously used.  In fact, before reaching the
James River I again reduced the artillery with the army largely.</p>

<p>I believed that, if one corps of the army was exposed on the
road to Richmond, and at a distance from the main army, Lee
would endeavor to attack the exposed corps before reinforcements
could come up; in which case the main army could follow Lee up
and attack him before he had time to intrench.  So I issued the
following orders:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H., VA.,
<br>May 18, 1864.</p>

<p>MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,
<br>Commanding Army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>Before daylight to-morrow morning I propose to draw Hancock and
Burnside from the position they now hold, and put Burnside to
the left of Wright.  Wright and Burnside should then force their
way up as close to the enemy as they can get without a general
engagement, or with a general engagement if the enemy will come
out of their works to fight, and intrench.  Hancock should march
and take up a position as if in support of the two left corps.
To-morrow night, at twelve or one o'clock, he will be moved
south-east with all his force and as much cavalry as can be
given to him, to get as far towards Richmond on the line of the
Fredericksburg Railroad as he can make, fighting the enemy in
whatever force he can find him.  If the enemy make a general
move to meet this, they will be followed by the other three
corps of the army, and attacked, if possible, before time is
given to intrench.</p>

<p>Suitable directions will at once be given for all trains and
surplus artillery to conform to this movement.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
On the 20th, Lee showing no signs of coming out of his lines,
orders were renewed for a left-flank movement, to commence after
night.</p>


<br><br><br><br>
<a name="ch54"></a><center><h2>CHAPTER LIV.</h2></center>

<center><h3>MOVEMENT BY THE LEFT FLANK&mdash;BATTLE OF NORTH ANNA&mdash;AN INCIDENT OF
THE MARCH&mdash;MOVING ON RICHMOND&mdash;SOUTH OF THE PAMUNKEY&mdash;POSITION OF
THE NATIONAL ARMY.</h3></center>
<br>

<p>We were now to operate in a different country from any we had
before seen in Virginia.  The roads were wide and good, and the
country well cultivated.  No men were seen except those bearing
arms, even the black man having been sent away.  The country,
however, was new to us, and we had neither guides nor maps to
tell us where the roads were, or where they led to.  Engineer
and staff officers were put to the dangerous duty of supplying
the place of both maps and guides.  By reconnoitring they were
enabled to locate the roads in the vicinity of each army
corps.  Our course was south, and we took all roads leading in
that direction which would not separate the army too widely.</p>

<p>Hancock who had the lead had marched easterly to Guiney's
Station, on the Fredericksburg Railroad, thence southerly to
Bowling Green and Milford.  He was at Milford by the night of
the 21st.  Here he met a detachment of Pickett's division coming
from Richmond to reinforce Lee.  They were speedily driven away,
and several hundred captured.  Warren followed on the morning of
the 21st, and reached Guiney's Station that night without
molestation.  Burnside and Wright were retained at Spottsylvania
to keep up the appearance of an intended assault, and to hold
Lee, if possible, while Hancock and Warren should get start
enough to interpose between him and Richmond.</p>

<p>Lee had now a superb opportunity to take the initiative either
by attacking Wright and Burnside alone, or by following by the
Telegraph Road and striking Hancock's and Warren's corps, or
even Hancock's alone, before reinforcements could come up.  But
he did not avail himself of either opportunity.  He seemed
really to be misled as to my designs; but moved by his interior
line&mdash;the Telegraph Road&mdash;to make sure of keeping between his
capital and the Army of the Potomac.  He never again had such an
opportunity of dealing a heavy blow.</p>

<p>The evening of the 21st Burnside, 9th corps, moved out followed
by Wright, 6th corps.  Burnside was to take the Telegraph Road;
but finding Stanard's Ford, over the Po, fortified and guarded,
he turned east to the road taken by Hancock and Warren without
an attempt to dislodge the enemy.  The night of the 21st I had
my headquarters near the 6th corps, at Guiney's Station, and the
enemy's cavalry was between us and Hancock.  There was a slight
attack on Burnside's and Wright's corps as they moved out of
their lines; but it was easily repulsed.  The object probably
was only to make sure that we were not leaving a force to follow
upon the rear of the Confederates.</p>

<p>By the morning of the 22d Burnside and Wright were at Guiney's
Station.  Hancock's corps had now been marching and fighting
continuously for several days, not having had rest even at night
much of the time.  They were, therefore, permitted to rest during
the 22d.  But Warren was pushed to Harris's Store, directly west
of Milford, and connected with it by a good road, and Burnside
was sent to New Bethel Church.  Wright's corps was still back at
Guiney's Station.</p>

<p>I issued the following order for the movement of the troops the
next day:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
NEW BETHEL, VA., May 22, 1864</p>

<p>MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,
<br>Commanding Army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>Direct corps commanders to hold their troops in readiness to
march at five A.M. to-morrow.  At that hour each command will
send out cavalry and infantry on all roads to their front
leading south, and ascertain, if possible, where the enemy is.
If beyond the South Anna, the 5th and 6th corps will march to
the forks of the road, where one branch leads to Beaver Dam
Station, the other to Jericho Bridge, then south by roads
reaching the Anna, as near to and east of Hawkins Creek as they
can be found.</p>

<p>The 2d corps will move to Chesterfield Ford.  The 9th corps will
be directed to move at the same time to Jericho Bridge.  The map
only shows two roads for the four corps to march upon, but, no
doubt, by the use of plantation roads, and pressing in guides,
others can be found, to give one for each corps.</p>

<p>The troops will follow their respective reconnoitring parties.
The trains will be moved at the same time to Milford Station.</p>

<p>Headquarters will follow the 9th corps.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.</p>

<p>
Warren's corps was moved from Harris's Store to Jericho Ford,
Wright's following.  Warren arrived at the ford early in the
afternoon, and by five o'clock effected a crossing under the
protection of sharpshooters.  The men had to wade in water up to
their waists.  As soon as enough troops were over to guard the
ford, pontoons were laid and the artillery and the rest of the
troops crossed.  The line formed was almost perpendicular to the
course of the river&mdash;Crawford on the left, next to the river,
Griffin in the centre, and Cutler on the right.  Lee was found
intrenched along the front of their line.  The whole of Hill's
corps was sent against Warren's right before it had got in
position.  A brigade of Cutler's division was driven back, the
enemy following, but assistance coming up the enemy was in turn
driven back into his trenches with heavy loss in killed and
wounded, with about five hundred prisoners left in our hands. By
night Wright's corps was up ready to reinforce Warren.</p>

<p>On the 23d Hancock's corps was moved to the wooden bridge which
spans the North Anna River just west of where the Fredericksburg
Railroad crosses.  It was near night when the troops arrived.
They found the bridge guarded, with troops intrenched, on the
north side.  Hancock sent two brigades, Egan's and Pierce's, to
the right and left, and when properly disposed they charged
simultaneously.  The bridge was carried quickly, the enemy
retreating over it so hastily that many were shoved into the
river, and some of them were drowned.  Several hundred prisoners
were captured.  The hour was so late that Hancock did not cross
until next morning.</p>

<p>Burnside's corps was moved by a middle road running between
those described above, and which strikes the North Anna at Ox
Ford, midway between Telegraph Road and Jericho Ford.  The hour
of its arrival was too late to cross that night.</p>

<p>On the 24th Hancock's corps crossed to the south side of the
river without opposition, and formed line facing nearly west.
The railroad in rear was taken possession of and destroyed as
far as possible.  Wright's corps crossed at Jericho early the
same day, and took position to the right of Warren's corps,
extending south of the Virginia Central Railroad.  This road was
torn up for a considerable distance to the rear (west), the ties
burned, and the rails bent and twisted by heating them over the
burning ties.  It was found, however, that Burnside's corps
could not cross at Ox Ford.  Lee had taken a position with his
centre on the river at this point, with the two wings thrown
back, his line making an acute angle where it overlooked the
river.</p>

<p>Before the exact position of the whole of Lee's line was
accurately known, I directed Hancock and Warren each to send a
brigade to Ox Ford by the south side of the river.  They found
the enemy too strong to justify a serious attack.  A third ford
was found between Ox Ford and Jericho.  Burnside was directed to
cross a division over this ford, and to send one division to
Hancock.  Crittenden was crossed by this newly-discovered ford,
and formed up the river to connect with Crawford's left.  Potter
joined Hancock by way of the wooden bridge.  Crittenden had a
severe engagement with some of Hill's corps on his crossing the
river, and lost heavily.  When joined to Warren's corps he was
no further molested.  Burnside still guarded Ox Ford from the
north side.</p>

<p>Lee now had his entire army south of the North Anna.  Our lines
covered his front, with the six miles separating the two wings
guarded by but a single division.  To get from one wing to the
other the river would have to be crossed twice.  Lee could
reinforce any part of his line from all points of it in a very
short march; or could concentrate the whole of it wherever he
might choose to assault.  We were, for the time, practically two
armies besieging.</p>

<p>Lee had been reinforced, and was being reinforced, largely.
About this time the very troops whose coming I had predicted,
had arrived or were coming in.  Pickett with a full division
from Richmond was up; Hoke from North Carolina had come with a
brigade; and Breckinridge was there:  in all probably not less
than fifteen thousand men.  But he did not attempt to drive us
from the field.</p>

<p>On the 22d or 23d I received dispatches from Washington saying
that Sherman had taken Kingston, crossed the Etowah River and
was advancing into Georgia.</p>

<p>I was seated at the time on the porch of a fine plantation house
waiting for Burnside's corps to pass.  Meade and his staff,
besides my own staff, were with me.  The lady of the house, a
Mrs. Tyler, and an elderly lady, were present.  Burnside seeing
us, came up on the porch, his big spurs and saber rattling as he
walked.  He touched his hat politely to the ladies, and remarked
that he supposed they had never seen so many "live Yankees"
before in their lives.  The elderly lady spoke up promptly
saying, "Oh yes, I have; many more."  "Where?" said Burnside.
"In Richmond."  Prisoners, of course, was understood.</p>

<p>I read my dispatch aloud, when it was received.  This threw the
younger lady into tears. I found the information she had
received (and I suppose it was the information generally in
circulation through the South) was that Lee was driving us from
the State in the most demoralized condition and that in the
South-west our troops were but little better than prisoners of
war.  Seeing our troops moving south was ocular proof that a
part of her information was incorrect, and she asked me if my
news from Sherman was true.  I assured her that there was no
doubt about it.  I left a guard to protect the house from
intrusion until the troops should have all passed, and assured
her that if her husband was in hiding she could bring him in and
he should be protected also.  But I presume he was in the
Confederate army.</p>

<p>On the 25th I gave orders, through Halleck, to Hunter, who had
relieved Sigel, to move up the Valley of Virginia, cross over
the Blue Ridge to Charlottesville and go as far as Lynchburg if
possible, living upon the country and cutting the railroads and
canal as he went.  After doing this he could find his way back
to his base, or join me.</p>

<p>On the same day news was received that Lee was falling back on
Richmond.  This proved not to be true.  But we could do nothing
where we were unless Lee would assume the offensive. I
determined, therefore, to draw out of our present position and
make one more effort to get between him and Richmond.  I had no
expectation now, however, of succeeding in this; but I did
expect to hold him far enough west to enable me to reach the
James River high up.  Sheridan was now again with the Army of
the Potomac.</p>

<p>On the 26th I informed the government at Washington of the
position of the two armies; of the reinforcements the enemy had
received; of the move I proposed to make; and directed
that our base of supplies should be shifted to White House, on
the Pamunkey.  The wagon train and guards moved directly from
Port Royal to White House.  Supplies moved around by water,
guarded by the navy.  Orders had previously been sent, through
Halleck, for Butler to send Smith's corps to White House.  This
order was repeated on the 25th, with directions that they should
be landed on the north side of the Pamunkey, and marched until
they joined the Army of the Potomac.</p>



<blockquote><blockquote>
<br>QUARLES' MILLS, VA., May 26, 1864.

<br><br>MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK,
<br>Washington, D. C.

<br><br>The relative position of the two armies is now as follows: Lee's
right rests on a swamp east of the Richmond and Fredericksburg
road and south of the North Anna, his centre on the river at Ox
Ford, and his left at Little River with the crossings of Little
River guarded as far up as we have gone. Hancock with his corps
and one division of the 9th corps crossed at Chesterfield Ford
and covers the right wing of Lee's army. One division of the 9th
corps is on the north bank of the Anna at Ox Ford, with bridges
above and below at points nearest to it where both banks are
held by us, so that it could reinforce either wing of our army
with equal facility.  The 5th and 6th corps with one division of
the 9th corps run from the south bank of the Anna from a short
distance above Ox Ford to Little River, and parallel with and
near to the enemy.

<br><br>To make a direct attack from either wing would cause a slaughter
of our men that even success would not justify.  To turn the
enemy by his right, between the two Annas is impossible on
account of the swamp upon which his right rests.  To turn him by
the left leaves Little River, New Found River and South Anna
River, all of them streams presenting considerable obstacles to
the movement of our army, to be crossed.  I have determined
therefore to turn the enemy's right by crossing at or near
Hanover Town.  This crosses all three streams at once, and
leaves us still where we can draw supplies.

<br><br>During the last night the teams and artillery not in position,
belonging to the right wing of our army, and one division of
that wing were quietly withdrawn to the north bank of the river
and moved down to the rear of the left.  As soon as it is dark
this division with most of the cavalry will commence a forced
march for Hanover Town to seize and hold the crossings.  The
balance of the right wing will withdraw at the same hour, and
follow as rapidly as possible.  The left wing will also withdraw
from the south bank of the river to-night and follow in rear of
the right wing.  Lee's army is really whipped.  The prisoners we
now take show it, and the action of his army shows it
unmistakably.  A battle with them outside of intrenchments
cannot be had.  Our men feel that they have gained the MORALE
over the enemy, and attack him with confidence.  I may be
mistaken, but I feel that our success over Lee's army is already
assured.  The promptness and rapidity with which you have
forwarded reinforcements has contributed largely to the feeling
of confidence inspired in our men, and to break down that of the
enemy.

<br><br>We are destroying all the rails we can on the Central and
Fredericksburg roads.  I want to leave a gap on the roads north
of Richmond so big that to get a single track they will have to
import rail from elsewhere.  Even if a crossing is not effected
at Hanover Town it will probably be necessary for us to move on
down the Pamunkey until a crossing is effected.  I think it
advisable therefore to change our base of supplies from Port
Royal to the White House.  I wish you would direct this change
at once, and also direct Smith to put the railroad bridge there
in condition for crossing troops and artillery and leave men to
hold it.

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.

<p>It was a delicate move to get the right wing of the Army of the
Potomac from its position south of the North Anna in the
presence of the enemy.  To accomplish it, I issued the following
order:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
<br>QUARLES' MILLS, VA., May 25, 1864.</p>

<p>MAJOR GENERAL MEADE,
<br>Commanding A. P.</p>

<p>Direct Generals Warren and Wright to withdraw all their teams
and artillery, not in position, to the north side of the river
to-morrow.  Send that belonging to General Wright's corps as far
on the road to Hanover Town as it can go, without attracting
attention to the fact.  Send with it Wright's best division or
division under his ablest commander.  Have their places filled
up in the line so if possible the enemy will not notice their
withdrawal.  Send the cavalry to-morrow afternoon, or as much of
it as you may deem necessary, to watch and seize, if they can,
Littlepage's Bridge and Taylor's Ford, and to remain on one or
other side of the river at these points until the infantry and
artillery all pass.  As soon as it is dark to-morrow night start
the division which you withdraw first from Wright's corps to make
a forced march to Hanover Town, taking with them no teams to
impede their march.  At the same time this division starts
commence withdrawing all of the 5th and 6th corps from the south
side of the river, and march them for the same place.  The two
divisions of the 9th corps not now with Hancock, may be moved
down the north bank of the river where they will be handy to
support Hancock if necessary, or will be that much on their road
to follow the 5th and 6th corps.  Hancock should hold his command
in readiness to follow as soon as the way is clear for him.
To-morrow it will leave nothing for him to do, but as soon as he
can he should get all his teams and spare artillery on the road
or roads which he will have to take.  As soon as the troops
reach Hanover Town they should get possession of all the
crossings they can in that neighborhood.  I think it would be
well to make a heavy cavalry demonstration on the enemy's left,
to-morrow afternoon, also.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
Wilson's division of cavalry was brought up from the left and
moved by our right south to Little River.  Here he manoeuvred to
give the impression that we were going to attack the left flank
of Lee's army.</p>

<p>Under cover of night our right wing was withdrawn to the north
side of the river, Lee being completely deceived by Wilson's
feint.  On the afternoon of the 26th Sheridan moved, sending
Gregg's and Torbert's cavalry to Taylor's and Littlepage's fords
towards Hanover.  As soon as it was dark both divisions moved
quietly to Hanover Ferry, leaving small guards behind to keep up
the impression that crossings were to be attempted in the
morning.  Sheridan was followed by a division of infantry under
General Russell.  On the morning of the 27th the crossing was
effected with but little loss, the enemy losing thirty or forty,
taken prisoners.  Thus a position was secured south of the
Pamunkey.</p>

<p>Russell stopped at the crossing while the cavalry pushed on to
Hanover Town.  Here Barringer's, formerly Gordon's, brigade of
rebel cavalry was encountered, but it was speedily driven away.</p>

<p>Warren's and Wright's corps were moved by the rear of Burnside's
and Hancock's corps.  When out of the way these latter corps
followed, leaving pickets confronting the enemy.  Wilson's
cavalry followed last, watching all the fords until everything
had recrossed; then taking up the pontoons and destroying other
bridges, became the rear-guard.</p>

<br><br>
<br><br>

<p>Two roads were traversed by the troops in this move.  The one
nearest to and north of the North Anna and Pamunkey was taken by
Wright, followed by Hancock.  Warren, followed by Burnside, moved
by a road farther north, and longer.  The trains moved by a road
still farther north, and had to travel a still greater
distance.  All the troops that had crossed the Pamunkey on the
morning of the 27th remained quiet during the rest of the day,
while the troops north of that stream marched to reach the
crossing that had been secured for them.</p>

<p>Lee had evidently been deceived by our movement from North Anna;
for on the morning of the 27th he telegraphed to Richmond:
"Enemy crossed to north side, and cavalry and infantry crossed
at Hanover Town."  The troops that had then crossed left his
front the night of the 25th.</p>

<p>The country we were now in was a difficult one to move troops
over.  The streams were numerous, deep and sluggish, sometimes
spreading out into swamps grown up with impenetrable growths of
trees and underbrush.  The banks were generally low and marshy,
making the streams difficult to approach except where there were
roads and bridges.</p>

<p>Hanover Town is about twenty miles from Richmond.  There are two
roads leading there; the most direct and shortest one crossing
the Chickahominy at Meadow Bridge, near the Virginia Central
Railroad, the second going by New and Old Cold Harbor.  A few
miles out from Hanover Town there is a third road by way of
Mechanicsville to Richmond.  New Cold Harbor was important to us
because while there we both covered the roads back to White House
(where our supplies came from), and the roads south-east over
which we would have to pass to get to the James River below the
Richmond defences.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 28th the army made an early start, and by
noon all had crossed except Burnside's corps.  This was left on
the north side temporarily to guard the large wagon train.  A
line was at once formed extending south from the river, Wright's
corps on the right, Hancock's in the centre, and Warren's on the
left, ready to meet the enemy if he should come.</p>

<p>At the same time Sheridan was directed to reconnoitre towards
Mechanicsville to find Lee's position.  At Hawes' Shop, just
where the middle road leaves the direct road to Richmond, he
encountered the Confederate cavalry dismounted and partially
intrenched.  Gregg attacked with his division, but was unable to
move the enemy.  In the evening Custer came up with a brigade.
The attack was now renewed, the cavalry dismounting and charging
as infantry.  This time the assault was successful, both sides
losing a considerable number of men.  But our troops had to bury
the dead, and found that more Confederate than Union soldiers had
been killed.  The position was easily held, because our infantry
was near.</p>

<p>On the 29th a reconnoissance was made in force, to find the
position of Lee.  Wright's corps pushed to Hanover Court
House.  Hancock's corps pushed toward Totopotomoy Creek;
Warren's corps to the left on the Shady Grove Church Road, while
Burnside was held in reserve. Our advance was pushed forward
three miles on the left with but little fighting.  There was now
an appearance of a movement past our left flank, and Sheridan was
sent to meet it.</p>

<p>On the 30th Hancock moved to the Totopotomoy, where he found the
enemy strongly fortified.  Wright was moved to the right of
Hancock's corps, and Burnside was brought forward and crossed,
taking position to the left of Hancock.  Warren moved up near
Huntley Corners on the Shady Grove Church Road.  There was some
skirmishing along the centre, and in the evening Early attacked
Warren with some vigor, driving him back at first, and
threatening to turn our left flank.  As the best means of
reinforcing the left, Hancock was ordered to attack in his
front.  He carried and held the rifle-pits.  While this was
going on Warren got his men up, repulsed Early, and drove him
more than a mile.</p>

<p>On this day I wrote to Halleck ordering all the pontoons in
Washington to be sent to City Point.</p>

<br><br>

<p>In the evening news was received of the arrival of Smith with
his corps at White House.  I notified Meade, in writing, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
NEAR HAWES' SHOP, VA.,
<br>6.40 P.M., May 30, 1864.</p>

<p>MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,
<br>Commanding A. P.</p>

<p>General Smith will debark his force at the White House tonight
and start up the south bank of the Pamunkey at an early hour,
probably at 3 A.M. in the morning.  It is not improbable that
the enemy, being aware of Smith's movement, will be feeling to
get on our left flank for the purpose of cutting him off, or by
a dash to crush him and get back before we are aware of it.
Sheridan ought to be notified to watch the enemy's movements
well out towards Cold Harbor, and also on the Mechanicsville
road.  Wright should be got well massed on Hancock's right, so
that, if it becomes necessary, he can take the place of the
latter readily whilst troops are being thrown east of the
Totopotomoy if necessary.</p>

<p>I want Sheridan to send a cavalry force of at least half a
brigade, if not a whole brigade, at 5 A.M. in the morning, to
communicate with Smith and to return with him.  I will send
orders for Smith by the messenger you send to Sheridan with his
orders.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
I also notified Smith of his danger, and the precautions that
would be taken to protect him.</p>

<p>The night of the 30th Lee's position was substantially from
Atlee's Station on the Virginia Central Railroad south and east
to the vicinity of Cold Harbor.  Ours was:  The left of Warren's
corps was on the Shady Grove Road, extending to the
Mechanicsville Road and about three miles south of the
Totopotomoy.  Burnside to his right, then Hancock, and Wright on
the extreme right, extending towards Hanover Court House, six
miles south-east of it.  Sheridan with two divisions of cavalry
was watching our left front towards Cold Harbor.  Wilson with
his division on our right was sent to get on the Virginia
Central Railroad and destroy it as far back as possible.  He got
possession of Hanover Court House the next day after a skirmish
with Young's cavalry brigade.  The enemy attacked Sheridan's
pickets, but reinforcements were sent up and the attack was
speedily repulsed and the enemy followed some distance towards
Cold Harbor.</p>



<br><br><br><br>
<a name="ch55"></a><center><h2>CHAPTER LV.</h2></center>

<center><h3>ADVANCE ON COLD HARBOR&mdash;AN ANECDOTE OF THE WAR&mdash;BATTLE OF COLD
HARBOR&mdash;CORRESPONDENCE WITH LEE&mdash;RETROSPECTIVE.</h3></center>
<br>

<p>On the 31st Sheridan advanced to near Old Cold Harbor.  He found
it intrenched and occupied by cavalry and infantry.  A hard fight
ensued but the place was carried.  The enemy well knew the
importance of Cold Harbor to us, and seemed determined that we
should not hold it.  He returned with such a large force that
Sheridan was about withdrawing without making any effort to hold
it against such odds; but about the time he commenced the
evacuation he received orders to hold the place at all hazards,
until reinforcements could be sent to him.  He speedily turned
the rebel works to face against them and placed his men in
position for defence.  Night came on before the enemy was ready
for assault.</p>

<p>Wright's corps was ordered early in the evening to march
directly to Cold Harbor passing by the rear of the army.  It was
expected to arrive by daylight or before; but the night was dark
and the distance great, so that it was nine o'clock the 1st of
June before it reached its destination.  Before the arrival of
Wright the enemy had made two assaults on Sheridan, both of
which were repulsed with heavy loss to the enemy.  Wright's
corps coming up, there was no further assault on Cold Harbor.</p>

<p>Smith, who was coming up from White House, was also directed to
march directly to Cold Harbor, and was expected early on the
morning of the 1st of June; but by some blunder the order which
reached Smith directed him to Newcastle instead of Cold
Harbor.  Through this blunder Smith did not reach his
destination until three o'clock in the afternoon, and then with
tired and worn-out men from their long and dusty march.  He
landed twelve thousand five hundred men from Butler's command,
but a division was left at White House temporarily and many men
had fallen out of ranks in their long march.</p>

<p>Before the removal of Wright's corps from our right, after dark
on the 31st, the two lines, Federal and Confederate, were so
close together at that point that either side could detect
directly any movement made by the other.  Finding at daylight
that Wright had left his front, Lee evidently divined that he
had gone to our left.  At all events, soon after light on the
1st of June Anderson, who commanded the corps on Lee's left, was
seen moving along Warren's front.  Warren was ordered to attack
him vigorously in flank, while Wright was directed to move out
and get on his front.  Warren fired his artillery at the enemy;
but lost so much time in making ready that the enemy got by, and
at three o'clock he reported the enemy was strongly intrenched in
his front, and besides his lines were so long that he had no mass
of troops to move with.  He seemed to have forgotten that lines
in rear of an army hold themselves while their defenders are
fighting in their front.  Wright reconnoitred some distance to
his front:  but the enemy finding Old Cold Harbor already taken
had halted and fortified some distance west.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<center><a name="b267"></a><img alt="b267.jpg (105K)" src="images/b267.jpg" height="378" width="650">
</center>
<br><br>
<center><a href="images/b267.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"></a></center>
<br><br>

<p>By six o'clock in the afternoon Wright and Smith were ready to
make an assault.  In front of both the ground was clear for
several hundred yards and then became wooded.  Both charged
across this open space and into the wood, capturing and holding
the first line of rifle-pits of the enemy, and also capturing
seven or eight hundred prisoners.</p>

<p>While this was going on, the enemy charged Warren three separate
times with vigor, but were repulsed each time with loss.  There
was no officer more capable, nor one more prompt in acting, than
Warren when the enemy forced him to it.  There was also an attack
upon Hancock's and Burnside's corps at the same time; but it was
feeble and probably only intended to relieve Anderson who was
being pressed by Wright and Smith.</p>

<p>During the night the enemy made frequent attacks with the view
of dispossessing us of the important position we had gained, but
without effecting their object.</p>

<p>Hancock was moved from his place in line during the night and
ordered to the left of Wright.  I expected to take the offensive
on the morning of the 2d, but the night was so dark, the heat and
dust so excessive and the roads so intricate and hard to keep,
that the head of column only reached Old Cold Harbor at six
o'clock, but was in position at 7.30 A.M.  Preparations were
made for an attack in the afternoon, but did not take place
until the next morning.  Warren's corps was moved to the left to
connect with Smith:  Hancock's corps was got into position to the
left of Wright's, and Burnside was moved to Bethesda Church in
reserve. While Warren and Burnside were making these changes the
enemy came out several times and attacked them, capturing several
hundred prisoners.  The attacks were repulsed, but not followed
up as they should have been.  I was so annoyed at this that I
directed Meade to instruct his corps commanders that they should
seize all such opportunities when they occurred, and not wait for
orders, all of our manoeuvres being made for the very purpose of
getting the enemy out of his cover.</p>

<p>On this day Wilson returned from his raid upon the Virginia
Central Railroad, having damaged it considerably.  But, like
ourselves, the rebels had become experts in repairing such
damage.  Sherman, in his memoirs, relates an anecdote of his
campaign to Atlanta that well illustrates this point.  The rebel
cavalry lurking in his rear to burn bridges and obstruct his
communications had become so disgusted at hearing trains go
whistling by within a few hours after a bridge had been burned,
that they proposed to try blowing up some of the tunnels.  One
of them said, "No use, boys, Old Sherman carries duplicate
tunnels with him, and will replace them as fast as you can blow
them up; better save your powder."</p>

<p>Sheridan was engaged reconnoitring the banks of the
Chickahominy, to find crossings and the condition of the
roads.  He reported favorably.</p>

<p>During the night Lee moved his left up to make his line
correspond to ours.  His lines extended now from the Totopotomoy
to New Cold Harbor.  Mine from Bethesda Church by Old Cold Harbor
to the Chickahominy, with a division of cavalry guarding our
right.  An assault was ordered for the 3d, to be made mainly by
the corps of Hancock, Wright and Smith; but Warren and Burnside
were to support it by threatening Lee's left, and to attack with
great earnestness if he should either reinforce more threatened
points by drawing from that quarter or if a favorable
opportunity should present itself.</p>

<p>The corps commanders were to select the points in their
respective fronts where they would make their assaults.  The
move was to commence at half-past four in the morning.  Hancock
sent Barlow and Gibbon forward at the appointed hour, with
Birney as a reserve.  Barlow pushed forward with great vigor,
under a heavy fire of both artillery and musketry, through
thickets and swamps.  Notwithstanding all the resistance of the
enemy and the natural obstructions to overcome, he carried a
position occupied by the enemy outside their main line where the
road makes a deep cut through a bank affording as good a shelter
for troops as if it had been made for that purpose.  Three
pieces of artillery had been captured here, and several hundred
prisoners.  The guns were immediately turned against the men who
had just been using them.  No assistance coming to him, he
(Barlow) intrenched under fire and continued to hold his
place.  Gibbon was not so fortunate in his front.  He found the
ground over which he had to pass cut up with deep ravines, and a
morass difficult to cross.  But his men struggled on until some
of them got up to the very parapet covering the enemy.  Gibbon
gained ground much nearer the enemy than that which he left, and
here he intrenched and held fast.</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<br>NEAR COLD HARBOR, June 3, 1864, 7 A.M.

<br><br>MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,
<br>Commanding A. P.

<br><br>The moment it becomes certain that an assault cannot succeed,
suspend the offensive; but when one does succeed, push it
vigorously and if necessary pile in troops at the successful
point from wherever they can be taken.  I shall go to where you
are in the course of an hour.

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Wright's corps moving in two lines captured the outer rifle-pits
in their front, but accomplished nothing more.  Smith's corps
also gained the outer rifle-pits in its front.  The ground over
which this corps (18th) had to move was the most exposed of any
over which charges were made.  An open plain intervened between
the contending forces at this point, which was exposed both to a
direct and a cross fire.  Smith, however, finding a ravine
running towards his front, sufficiently deep to protect men in
it from cross fire, and somewhat from a direct fire, put
Martindale's division in it, and with Brooks supporting him on
the left and Devens on the right succeeded in gaining the
outer&mdash;probably picket&mdash;rifle-pits.  Warren and Burnside also
advanced and gained ground&mdash;which brought the whole army on one
line.</p>

<p>This assault cost us heavily and probably without benefit to
compensate:  but the enemy was not cheered by the occurrence
sufficiently to induce him to take the offensive.  In fact,
nowhere after the battle of the Wilderness did Lee show any
disposition to leave his defences far behind him.</p>

<p>Fighting was substantially over by half-past seven in the
morning.  At eleven o'clock I started to visit all the corps
commanders to see for myself the different positions gained and
to get their opinion of the practicability of doing anything
more in their respective fronts.</p>

<p>Hancock gave the opinion that in his front the enemy was too
strong to make any further assault promise success.  Wright
thought he could gain the lines of the enemy, but it would
require the cooperation of Hancock's and Smith's corps.  Smith
thought a lodgment possible, but was not sanguine:  Burnside
thought something could be done in his front, but Warren
differed.  I concluded, therefore to make no more assaults, and
a little after twelve directed in the following letter that all
offensive action should cease.</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
COLD HARBOR, June 3, 1864.-12.30 P.M.
<br>MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,</p>

<p>Commanding A. P.</p>

<p>The opinion of corps commanders not being sanguine of success in
case an assault is ordered, you may direct a suspension of
farther advance for the present.  Hold our most advanced
positions and strengthen them.  Whilst on the defensive our line
may be contracted from the right if practicable.</p>

<p>Reconnoissances should be made in front of every corps and
advances made to advantageous positions by regular approaches.
To aid the expedition under General Hunter it is necessary that
we should detain all the army now with Lee until the former gets
well on his way to Lynchburg.  To do this effectually it will be
better to keep the enemy out of the intrenchments of Richmond
than to have them go back there.</p>

<p>Wright and Hancock should be ready to assault in case the enemy
should break through General Smith's lines, and all should be
ready to resist an assault.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
The remainder of the day was spent in strengthening the line we
now held.  By night we were as strong against Lee as he was
against us.</p>

<p>During the night the enemy quitted our right front, abandoning
some of their wounded, and without burying their dead.  These we
were able to care for.  But there were many dead and wounded men
between the lines of the contending forces, which were now close
together, who could not be cared for without a cessation of
hostilities.</p>

<p>So I wrote the following:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
COLD HARBOR, VA., June 5, 1864.</p>

<p>GENERAL R.  E. LEE,
<br>Commanding Confederate Army.</p>

<p>It is reported to me that there are wounded men, probably of
both armies, now lying exposed and suffering between the lines
occupied respectively by the two armies.  Humanity would dictate
that some provision should be made to provide against such
hardships.  I would propose, therefore, that hereafter, when no
battle is raging, either party be authorized to send to any
point between the pickets or skirmish lines, unarmed men bearing
litters to pick up their dead or wounded, without being fired
upon by the other party.  Any other method, equally fair to both
parties, you may propose for meeting the end desired will be
accepted by me.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
Lee replied that he feared such an arrangement would lead to
misunderstanding, and proposed that in future, when either party
wished to remove their dead and wounded, a flag of truce be
sent.  I answered this immediately by saying:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
COLD HARBOR, VA., June 6, 1864.</p>

<p>GENERAL R. E. LEE,
<br>Commanding Army of N. Va.</p>

<p>Your communication of yesterday's date is received.  I will
send immediately, as you propose, to collect the dead and
wounded between the lines of the two armies, and will also
instruct that you be allowed to do the same.  I propose that the
time for doing this be between the hours of 12 M. and 3 P.M.
to-day.  I will direct all parties going out to bear a white
flag, and not to attempt to go beyond where we have dead or
wounded, and not beyond or on ground occupied by your troops.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
Lee's response was that he could not consent to the burial of
the dead and removal of the wounded in the way I proposed, but
when either party desired such permission it should be asked for
by flag of truce and he had directed that any parties I may have
sent out, as mentioned in my letter, to be turned back.  I
answered:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
<br>COLD HARBOR, VA, June 6, 1864.</p>

<p>GENERAL R. E. LEE.
<br>Commanding Army, N. Va.</p>

<p>The knowledge that wounded men are now suffering from want of
attention, between the two armies, compels me to ask a
suspension of hostilities for sufficient time to collect them
in, say two hours.  Permit me to say that the hours you may fix
upon for this will be agreeable to me, and the same privilege
will be extended to such parties as you may wish to send out on
the same duty without further application.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
Lee acceded to this; but delays in transmitting the
correspondence brought it to the 7th of June&mdash;forty-eight hours
after it commenced&mdash;before parties were got out to collect the
men left upon the field.  In the meantime all but two of the
wounded had died.  And I wrote to Lee:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
COLD HARBOR, VA., June 7, 1864.
<br>10.30 A.M.</p>

<p>GEN. R. E. LEE,
<br>Commanding Army of N. Va.</p>

<p>I regret that your note of seven P.M. yesterday should have been
received at the nearest corps headquarters, to where it was
delivered, after the hour which had been given for the removal
of the dead and wounded had expired; 10.45 P.M. was the hour at
which it was received at corps headquarters, and between eleven
and twelve it reached my headquarters.  As a consequence, it was
not understood by the troops of this army that there was a
cessation of hostilities for the purpose of collecting the dead
and wounded, and none were collected.  Two officers and six men
of the 8th and 25th North Carolina Regts., who were out in
search of the bodies of officers of their respective regiments,
were captured and brought into our lines, owing to this want of
understanding.  I regret this, but will state that as soon as I
learned the fact, I directed that they should not be held as
prisoners, but must be returned to their commands.  These
officers and men having been carelessly brought through our
lines to the rear have not determined whether they will be sent
back the way they came, or whether they will be sent by some
other route.</p>

<p>Regretting that all my efforts for alleviating the sufferings of
wounded men left upon the battle-field have been rendered
nugatory, I remain, &amp;.,</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
I have always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was
ever made.  I might say the same thing of the assault of the 22d
of May, 1863, at Vicksburg.  At Cold Harbor no advantage
whatever was gained to compensate for the heavy loss we
sustained.  Indeed, the advantages other than those of relative
losses, were on the Confederate side.  Before that, the Army of
Northern Virginia seemed to have acquired a wholesome regard for
the courage, endurance, and soldierly qualities generally of the
Army of the Potomac.  They no longer wanted to fight them "one
Confederate to five Yanks."  Indeed, they seemed to have given
up any idea of gaining any advantage of their antagonist in the
open field.  They had come to much prefer breastworks in their
front to the Army of the Potomac.  This charge seemed to revive
their hopes temporarily; but it was of short duration.  The
effect upon the Army of the Potomac was the reverse.  When we
reached the James River, however, all effects of the battle of
Cold Harbor seemed to have disappeared.</p>

<p>There was more justification for the assault at Vicksburg.  We
were in a Southern climate, at the beginning of the hot
season.  The Army of the Tennessee had won five successive
victories over the garrison of Vicksburg in the three preceding
weeks.  They had driven a portion of that army from Port Gibson
with considerable loss, after having flanked them out of their
stronghold at Grand Gulf.  They had attacked another portion of
the same army at Raymond, more than fifty miles farther in the
interior of the State, and driven them back into Jackson with
great loss in killed, wounded, captured and missing, besides
loss of large and small arms:  they had captured the capital of
the State of Mississippi, with a large amount of materials of
war and manufactures.  Only a few days before, they had beaten
the enemy then penned up in the town first at Champion's Hill,
next at Big Black River Bridge, inflicting upon him a loss of
fifteen thousand or more men (including those cut off from
returning) besides large losses in arms and ammunition.  The
Army of the Tennessee had come to believe that they could beat
their antagonist under any circumstances.  There was no telling
how long a regular siege might last.  As I have stated, it was
the beginning of the hot season in a Southern climate.  There
was no telling what the casualties might be among Northern
troops working and living in trenches, drinking surface water
filtered through rich vegetation, under a tropical sun.  If
Vicksburg could have been carried in May, it would not only have
saved the army the risk it ran of a greater danger than from the
bullets of the enemy, but it would have given us a splendid
army, well equipped and officered, to operate elsewhere with.
These are reasons justifying the assault.  The only benefit we
gained&mdash;and it was a slight one for so great a sacrifice&mdash;was
that the men worked cheerfully in the trenches after that, being
satisfied with digging the enemy out.  Had the assault not been
made, I have no doubt that the majority of those engaged in the
siege of Vicksburg would have believed that had we assaulted it
would have proven successful, and would have saved life, health
and comfort.</p>

<center><h3>LEFT FLANK MOVEMENT ACROSS THE CHICKAHOMINY AND JAMES&mdash;GENERAL
LEE&mdash;VISIT TO BUTLER&mdash;THE MOVEMENT ON PETERSBURG&mdash;THE INVESTMENT
OF PETERSBURG.</h3></center>
<br>

<p>Lee's position was now so near Richmond, and the intervening
swamps of the Chickahominy so great an obstacle to the movement
of troops in the face of an enemy, that I determined to make my
next left flank move carry the Army of the Potomac south of the
James River.  Preparations for this were promptly
commenced. The move was a hazardous one to make:  the
Chickahominy River, with its marshy and heavily timbered
approaches, had to be crossed; all the bridges over it east of
Lee were destroyed; the enemy had a shorter line and better
roads to travel on to confront me in crossing; more than fifty
miles intervened between me and Butler, by the roads I should
have to travel, with both the James and the Chickahominy
unbridged to cross; and last, the Army of the Potomac had to be
got out of a position but a few hundred yards from the enemy at
the widest place.  Lee, if he did not choose to follow me,
might, with his shorter distance to travel and his bridges over
the Chickahominy and the James, move rapidly on Butler and crush
him before the army with me could come to his relief.  Then too
he might spare troops enough to send against Hunter who was
approaching Lynchburg, living upon the country he passed
through, and without ammunition further than what he carried
with him.</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<br>COLD HARBOR, June 5,1864.

<br><br>MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Chief of Staff of the Army, Washington,
D. C.

<br><br>A full survey of all the ground satisfies me that it would be
impracticable to hold a line north-east of Richmond that would
protect the Fredericksburg Railroad to enable us to use that
road for supplying the army.  To do so would give us a long
vulnerable line of road to protect, exhausting much of our
strength to guard it, and would leave open to the enemy all of
his lines of communication on the south side of the James.  My
idea from the start has been to beat Lee's army if possible
north of Richmond; then after destroying his lines of
communication on the north side of the James River to transfer
the army to the south side and besiege Lee in Richmond, or
follow him south if he should retreat.

<br><br>I now find, after over thirty days of trial, the enemy deems it
of the first importance to run no risks with the armies they now
have.  They act purely on the defensive behind breastworks, or
feebly on the offensive immediately in front of them, and where
in case of repulse they can instantly retire behind them.
Without a greater sacrifice of human life than I am willing to
make all cannot be accomplished that I had designed outside of
the city.  I have therefore resolved upon the following plan:

<br><br>I will continue to hold substantially the ground now occupied by
the Army of the Potomac, taking advantage of any favorable
circumstance that may present itself until the cavalry can be
sent west to destroy the Virginia Central Railroad from about
Beaver Dam for some twenty-five or thirty miles west.  When this
is effected I will move the army to the south side of the James
River, either by crossing the Chickahominy and marching near to
City Point, or by going to the mouth of the Chickahominy on
north side and crossing there.  To provide for this last and
most possible contingency, several ferry-boats of the largest
class ought to be immediately provided.

<br><br>Once on the south side of the James River, I can cut off all
sources of supply to the enemy except what is furnished by the
canal.  If Hunter succeeds in reaching Lynchburg, that will be
lost to him also.  Should Hunter not succeed, I will still make
the effort to destroy the canal by sending cavalry up the south
side of the river with a pontoon train to cross wherever they
can.

<br><br>The feeling of the two armies now seems to be that the rebels
can protect themselves only by strong intrenchments, whilst our
army is not only confident of protecting itself without
intrenchments, but that it can beat and drive the enemy wherever
and whenever he can be found without this protection.

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.

<p>But the move had to be made, and I relied upon Lee's not seeing
my danger as I saw it.  Besides we had armies on both sides of
the James River and not far from the Confederate capital.  I
knew that its safety would be a matter of the first
consideration with the executive, legislative and judicial
branches of the so-called Confederate government, if it was not
with the military commanders.  But I took all the precaution I
knew of to guard against all dangers.</p>

<p>Sheridan was sent with two divisions, to communicate with Hunter
and to break up the Virginia Central Railroad and the James River
Canal, on the 7th of June, taking instructions to Hunter to come
back with him.</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<br>COLD HARBOR, VA., June 6, 1864.

<br><br>MAJOR-GENERAL D. HUNTER

<br><br>Commanding Dept. W. Va.

<br><br>General Sheridan leaves here to-morrow morning, with
instructions to proceed to Charlottesville, Va., and to commence
there the destruction of the Va. Cen. R. R., destroying this way
as much as possible.  The complete destruction of this road and
of the canal on James River is of great importance to us.
According to the instructions I sent to General Halleck for your
guidance, you were to proceed to Lynchburg and commence there. It
would be of great value to us to get possession of Lynchburg for
a single day.  But that point is of so much importance to the
enemy, that in attempting to get it such resistance may be met
as to defeat your getting onto the road or canal at all.  I see,
in looking over the letter to General Halleck on the subject of
your instructions, that it rather indicates that your route
should be from Staunton via Charlottesville.  If you have so
understood it, you will be doing just what I want.  The
direction I would now give is, that if this letter reaches you
in the valley between Staunton and Lynchburg, you immediately
turn east by the most practicable road.  From thence move
eastward along the line of the road, destroying it completely
and thoroughly, until you join General Sheridan.  After the work
laid out for General Sheridan and yourself is thoroughly done,
proceed to join the Army of the Potomac by the route laid out in
General Sheridan's instructions.

<br><br>If any portion of your force, especially your cavalry, is needed
back in your Department, you are authorized to send it back.

<br><br>If on receipt of this you should be near to Lynchburg and deem
it practicable to detach a cavalry force to destroy the canal.
Lose no opportunity to destroy the canal.

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Hunter was also informed by way of
Washington and the Valley that Sheridan was on the way to meet
him.  The canal and Central Road, and the regions penetrated by
them, were of vast importance to the enemy, furnishing and
carrying a large per cent. of all the supplies for the Army of
Northern Virginia and the people of Richmond.  Before Sheridan
got off on the 7th news was received from Hunter reporting his
advance to Staunton and successful engagement with the enemy
near that place on the 5th, in which the Confederate commander,
W. S. Jones, was killed.  On the 4th of June the enemy having
withdrawn his left corps, Burnside on our right was moved up
between Warren and Smith.  On the 5th Birney returned to
Hancock, which extended his left now to the Chickahominy, and
Warren was withdrawn to Cold Harbor.  Wright was directed to
send two divisions to the left to extend down the banks of that
stream to Bottom's Bridge.  The cavalry extended still farther
east to Jones's Bridge.</p>

<p>On the 7th Abercrombie&mdash;who was in command at White House, and
who had been in command at our base of supplies in all the
changes made from the start&mdash;was ordered to take up the iron
from the York River Railroad and put it on boats, and to be in
readiness to move by water to City Point.</p>

<p>On the 8th Meade was directed to fortify a line down the bank
overlooking the Chickahominy, under cover of which the army
could move.</p>

<p>On the 9th Abercrombie was directed to send all organized troops
arriving at White House, without debarking from their transports,
to report to Butler.  Halleck was at this time instructed to send
all reinforcements to City Point.</p>

<p>On the 11th I wrote:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
COLD HARBOR, VA., June 11, 1864.</p>

<p>MAJOR-GEN. B. F. BUTLER,
<br>Commanding Department of Va. and N. C.</p>

<p>The movement to transfer this army to the south side of the
James River will commence after dark to-morrow night.  Col.
Comstock, of my staff, was sent specially to ascertain what was
necessary to make your position secure in the interval during
which the enemy might use most of his force against you, and
also, to ascertain what point on the river we should reach to
effect a crossing if it should not be practicable to reach this
side of the river at Bermuda Hundred.  Colonel Comstock has not
yet returned, so that I cannot make instructions as definite as
I would wish, but the time between this and Sunday night being
so short in which to get word to you, I must do the best I
can.  Colonel Dent goes to the Chickahominy to take to you the
18th corps.  The corps will leave its position in the trenches
as early in the evening, tomorrow, as possible, and make a
forced march to Cole's Landing or Ferry, where it should reach
by ten A.M. the following morning.  This corps numbers now
15,300 men.  They take with them neither wagons nor artillery;
these latter marching with the balance of the army to the James
River.  The remainder of the army will cross the Chickahominy at
Long Bridge and at Jones's, and strike the river at the most
practicable crossing below City Point.</p>

<p>I directed several days ago that all reinforcements for the army
should be sent to you.  I am not advised of the number that may
have gone, but suppose you have received from six to ten
thousand.  General Smith will also reach you as soon as the
enemy could, going by the way of Richmond.</p>

<p>The balance of the force will not be more than one day behind,
unless detained by the whole of Lee's army, in which case you
will be strong enough.</p>

<p>I wish you would direct the proper staff officers, your
chief-engineer and your chief-quartermaster, to commence at once
the collection of all the means in their reach for crossing the
army on its arrival.  If there is a point below City Point where
a pontoon bridge can be thrown, have it laid.</p>

<p>Expecting the arrival of the 18th corps by Monday night, if you
deem it practicable from the force you have to seize and hold
Petersburg, you may prepare to start, on the arrival of troops
to hold your present lines.  I do not want Petersburg visited,
however, unless it is held, nor an attempt to take it, unless
you feel a reasonable degree of confidence of success.  If you
should go there, I think troops should take nothing with them
except what they can carry, depending upon supplies being sent
after the place is secured.  If Colonel Dent should not succeed
in securing the requisite amount of transportation for the 18th
corps before reaching you, please have the balance supplied.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;On reflection I will send the 18th corps by way of White
House.  The distance which they will have to march will be
enough shorter to enable them to reach you about the same time,
and the uncertainty of navigation on the Chickahominy will be
avoided.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT.</p>

<br><br><br>

<p>
COLD HARBOR, VA., June 11,1864.</p>

<p>MAJOR-GENERAL G. G. MEADE,
<br>Commanding Army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>Colonel Comstock, who visited the James River for the purpose of
ascertaining the best point below Bermuda Hundred to which to
march the army has not yet returned.  It is now getting so late,
however, that all preparations may be made for the move to-morrow
night without waiting longer.</p>

<p>The movement will be made as heretofore agreed upon, that is,
the 18th corps make a rapid march with the infantry alone, their
wagons and artillery accompanying the balance of the army to
Cole's Landing or Ferry, and there embark for City Point, losing
no time for rest until they reach the latter point.</p>

<p>The 5th corps will seize Long Bridge and move out on the Long
Bridge Road to its junction with Quaker Road, or until stopped
by the enemy.</p>

<p>The other three corps will follow in such order as you may
direct, one of them crossing at Long Bridge, and two at Jones's
Bridge.  After the crossing is effected, the most practicable
roads will be taken to reach about Fort Powhattan.  Of course,
this is supposing the enemy makes no opposition to our
advance.  The 5th corps, after securing the passage of the
balance of the army, will join or follow in rear of the corps
which crosses the same bridge with themselves.  The wagon trains
should be kept well east of the troops, and if a crossing can be
found, or made lower down than Jones's they should take it.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;In view of the long march to reach Cole's Landing, and
the uncertainty of being able to embark a large number of men
there, the direction of the 18th corps may be changed to White
House.  They should be directed to load up transports, and start
them as fast as loaded without waiting for the whole corps or
even whole divisions to go together.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT.</p>

<p>
About this time word was received (through the Richmond papers
of the 11th) that Crook and Averell had united and were moving
east.  This, with the news of Hunter's successful engagement
near Staunton, was no doubt known to Lee before it was to me.
Then Sheridan leaving with two divisions of cavalry, looked
indeed threatening, both to Lee's communications and supplies.
Much of his cavalry was sent after Sheridan, and Early with
Ewell's entire corps was sent to the Valley.  Supplies were
growing scarce in Richmond, and the sources from which to draw
them were in our hands.  People from outside began to pour into
Richmond to help eat up the little on hand.  Consternation
reigned there.</p>

<p>On the 12th Smith was ordered to move at night to White House,
not to stop until he reached there, and to take boats at once
for City Point, leaving his trains and artillery to move by land.</p>

<p>Soon after dark some of the cavalry at Long Bridge effected a
crossing by wading and floundering through the water and mud,
leaving their horses behind, and drove away the cavalry
pickets.  A pontoon bridge was speedily thrown across, over
which the remainder of the army soon passed and pushed out for a
mile or two to watch and detain any advance that might be made
from the other side.  Warren followed the cavalry, and by the
morning of the 13th had his whole corps over.  Hancock followed
Warren.  Burnside took the road to Jones's Bridge, followed by
Wright.  Ferrero's division, with the wagon train, moved farther
east, by Window Shades and Cole's Ferry, our rear being covered
by cavalry.</p>

<p>It was known that the enemy had some gunboats at Richmond. These
might run down at night and inflict great damage upon us before
they could be sunk or captured by our navy.  General Butler had,
in advance, loaded some vessels with stone ready to be sunk so as
to obstruct the channel in an emergency.  On the 13th I sent
orders to have these sunk as high up the river as we could guard
them, and prevent their removal by the enemy.</p>

<p>As soon as Warren's corps was over the Chickahominy it marched
out and joined the cavalry in holding the roads from Richmond
while the army passed.  No attempt was made by the enemy to
impede our march, however, but Warren and Wilson reported the
enemy strongly fortified in their front.  By the evening of the
13th Hancock's corps was at Charles City Court House on the
James River.  Burnside's and Wright's corps were on the
Chickahominy, and crossed during the night, Warren's corps and
the cavalry still covering the army.  The material for a pontoon
bridge was already at hand and the work of laying it was
commenced immediately, under the superintendence of
Brigadier-General Benham, commanding the engineer brigade.  On
the evening of the 14th the crossing commenced, Hancock in
advance, using both the bridge and boats.</p>

<p>When the Wilderness campaign commenced the Army of the Potomac,
including Burnside's&mdash;which was a separate command until the
24th of May when it was incorporated with the main
army&mdash;numbered about 116,000 men.  During the progress of the
campaign about 40,000 reinforcements were received.  At the
crossing of the James River June 14th-15th the army numbered
about 115,000.  Besides the ordinary losses incident to a
campaign of six weeks' nearly constant fighting or skirmishing,
about one-half of the artillery was sent back to Washington, and
many men were discharged by reason of the expiration of their
term of service. In estimating our strength every enlisted man
and every commissioned officer present is included, no matter
how employed; in bands, sick in field hospitals, hospital
attendants, company cooks and all.  Operating in an enemy's
country, and being supplied always from a distant base, large
detachments had at all times to be sent from the front, not only
to guard the base of supplies and the roads to it, but all the
roads leading to our flanks and rear.  We were also operating in
a country unknown to us, and without competent guides or maps
showing the roads accurately.</p>

<p>The manner of estimating numbers in the two armies differs
materially.  In the Confederate army often only bayonets are
taken into account, never, I believe, do they estimate more than
are handling the guns of the artillery and armed with muskets
or carbines.  Generally the latter are far enough away to
be excluded from the count in any one field.  Officers and
details of enlisted men are not included.  In the Northern
armies the estimate is most liberal, taking in all connected
with the army and drawing pay.</p>

<p>Estimated in the same manner as ours, Lee had not less than
80,000 men at the start.  His reinforcements were about equal to
ours during the campaign, deducting the discharged men and those
sent back.  He was on the defensive, and in a country in which
every stream, every road, every obstacle to the movement of
troops and every natural defence was familiar to him and his
army.  The citizens were all friendly to him and his cause, and
could and did furnish him with accurate reports of our every
move.  Rear guards were not necessary for him, and having always
a railroad at his back, large wagon trains were not required. All
circumstances considered we did not have any advantage in
numbers.</p>

<p>General Lee, who had led the Army of Northern Virginia in all
these contests, was a very highly estimated man in the
Confederate army and States, and filled also a very high place
in the estimation of the people and press of the Northern
States.  His praise was sounded throughout the entire North
after every action he was engaged in:  the number of his forces
was always lowered and that of the National forces
exaggerated.  He was a large, austere man, and I judge difficult
of approach to his subordinates.  To be extolled by the entire
press of the South after every engagement, and by a portion of
the press North with equal vehemence, was calculated to give him
the entire confidence of his troops and to make him feared by his
antagonists.  It was not an uncommon thing for my staff-officers
to hear from Eastern officers, "Well, Grant has never met Bobby
Lee yet."  There were good and true officers who believe now
that the Army of Northern Virginia was superior to the Army of
the Potomac man to man.  I do not believe so, except as the
advantages spoken of above made them so.  Before the end I
believe the difference was the other way.  The Army of Northern
Virginia became despondent and saw the end.  It did not please
them.  The National army saw the same thing, and were encouraged
by it.</p>

<p>The advance of the Army of the Potomac reached the James on the
14th of June.  Preparations were at once commenced for laying
the pontoon bridges and crossing the river.  As already stated,
I had previously ordered General Butler to have two vessels
loaded with stone and carried up the river to a point above that
occupied by our gunboats, where the channel was narrow, and sunk
there so as to obstruct the passage and prevent Confederate
gunboats from coming down the river.  Butler had had these boats
filled and put in position, but had not had them sunk before my
arrival.  I ordered this done, and also directed that he should
turn over all material and boats not then in use in the river to
be used in ferrying the troops across.</p>

<p>I then, on the 14th, took a steamer and ran up to Bermuda
Hundred to see General Butler for the purpose of directing a
movement against Petersburg, while our troops of the Army of the
Potomac were crossing.</p>

<p>I had sent General W. F. Smith back from Cold Harbor by the way
of White House, thence on steamers to City Point for the purpose
of giving General Butler more troops with which to accomplish
this result.  General Butler was ordered to send Smith with his
troops reinforced, as far as that could be conveniently done,
from other parts of the Army of the James.  He gave Smith about
six thousand reinforcements, including some twenty-five hundred
cavalry under Kautz, and about thirty-five hundred colored
infantry under Hinks.</p>

<p>The distance which Smith had to move to reach the enemy's lines
was about six miles, and the Confederate advance line of works
was but two miles outside of Petersburg.  Smith was to move
under cover of night, up close to the enemy's works, and assault
as soon as he could after daylight.  I believed then, and still
believe, that Petersburg could have been easily captured at that
time.  It only had about 2,500 men in the defences besides some
irregular troops, consisting of citizens and employees in the
city who took up arms in case of emergency.  Smith started as
proposed, but his advance encountered a rebel force intrenched
between City Point and their lines outside of Petersburg.  This
position he carried, with some loss to the enemy; but there was
so much delay that it was daylight before his troops really got
off from there.  While there I informed General Butler that
Hancock's corps would cross the river and move to Petersburg to
support Smith in case the latter was successful, and that I
could reinforce there more rapidly than Lee could reinforce from
his position.</p>

<p>I returned down the river to where the troops of the Army of the
Potomac now were, communicated to General Meade, in writing, the
directions I had given to General Butler and directed him
(Meade) to cross Hancock's corps over under cover of night, and
push them forward in the morning to Petersburg; halting them,
however, at a designated point until they could hear from
Smith.  I also informed General Meade that I had ordered rations
from Bermuda Hundred for Hancock's corps, and desired him to
issue them speedily, and to lose no more time than was
absolutely necessary.  The rations did not reach him, however,
and Hancock, while he got all his corps over during the night,
remained until half-past ten in the hope of receiving them.  He
then moved without them, and on the road received a note from
General W. F. Smith, asking him to come on.  This seems to be
the first information that General Hancock had received of the
fact that he was to go to Petersburg, or that anything
particular was expected of him.  Otherwise he would have been
there by four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Smith arrived in front of the enemy's lines early in the
forenoon of the 15th, and spent the day until after seven
o'clock in the evening in reconnoitering what appeared to be
empty works.  The enemy's line consisted of redans occupying
commanding positions, with rifle-pits connecting them.  To the
east side of Petersburg, from the Appomattox back, there were
thirteen of these redans extending a distance of several miles,
probably three.  If they had been properly manned they could
have held out against any force that could have attacked them,
at least until reinforcements could have got up from the north
of Richmond.</p>

<p>Smith assaulted with the colored troops, and with success.  By
nine o'clock at night he was in possession of five of these
redans and, of course, of the connecting lines of rifle-pits.
All of them contained artillery, which fell into our hands.
Hancock came up and proposed to take any part assigned to him;
and Smith asked him to relieve his men who were in the trenches.</p>

<p>Next morning, the 16th, Hancock himself was in command, and
captured another redan.  Meade came up in the afternoon and
succeeded Hancock, who had to be relieved, temporarily, from the
command of his corps on account of the breaking out afresh of the
wound he had received at Gettysburg.  During the day Meade
assaulted and carried one more redan to his right and two to his
left.  In all this we lost very heavily.  The works were not
strongly manned, but they all had guns in them which fell into
our hands, together with the men who were handling them in the
effort to repel these assaults.</p>

<p>Up to this time Beauregard, who had commanded south of Richmond,
had received no reinforcements, except Hoke's division from
Drury's Bluff, which had arrived on the morning of the
16th; though he had urged the authorities very strongly to send
them, believing, as he did, that Petersburg would be a valuable
prize which we might seek.</p>

CITY POINT, VA., June 17, 1864.  11 A.M.

<<br><br>MAJOR-GEN. HALLECK,
<br>Washington, D. C.

<br>*******************************************

<br><br>The enemy in their endeavor to reinforce Petersburg abandoned
their intrenchments in front of Bermuda Hundred.  They no doubt
expected troops from north of the James River to take their
place before we discovered it.  General Butler took advantage of
this and moved a force at once upon the railroad and plank road
between Richmond and Petersburg, which I hope to retain
possession of.

<br><br>Too much credit cannot be given to the troops and their
commanders for the energy and fortitude displayed during the
last five days.  Day and night has been all the same, no delays
being allowed on any account.

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieut.-General.
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>During the 17th the fighting was very severe and the losses
heavy; and at night our troops occupied about the same position
they had occupied in the morning, except that they held a redan
which had been captured by Potter during the day.  During the
night, however, Beauregard fell back to the line which had been
already selected, and commenced fortifying it.  Our troops
advanced on the 18th to the line which he had abandoned, and
found that the Confederate loss had been very severe, many of
the enemy's dead still remaining in the ditches and in front of
them.</p>

<p>Colonel J. L. Chamberlain, of the 20th Maine, was wounded on the
18th.  He was gallantly leading his brigade at the time, as he
had been in the habit of doing in all the engagements in which
he had previously been engaged.  He had several times been
recommended for a brigadier-generalcy for gallant and
meritorious conduct.  On this occasion, however, I promoted him
on the spot, and forwarded a copy of my order to the War
Department, asking that my act might be confirmed and
Chamberlain's name sent to the Senate for confirmation without
any delay.  This was done, and at last a gallant and meritorious
officer received partial justice at the hands of his government,
which he had served so faithfully and so well.</p>

<p>If General Hancock's orders of the 15th had been communicated to
him, that officer, with his usual promptness, would undoubtedly
have been upon the ground around Petersburg as early as four
o'clock in the afternoon of the 15th.  The days were long and it
would have given him considerable time before night.  I do not
think there is any doubt that Petersburg itself could have been
carried without much loss; or, at least, if protected by inner
detached works, that a line could have been established very
much in rear of the one then occupied by the enemy.  This would
have given us control of both the Weldon and South Side
railroads.  This would also have saved an immense amount of hard
fighting which had to be done from the 15th to the 18th, and
would have given us greatly the advantage in the long siege
which ensued.</p>

<p>I now ordered the troops to be put under cover and allowed some
of the rest which they had so long needed.  They remained quiet,
except that there was more or less firing every day, until the
22d, when General Meade ordered an advance towards the Weldon
Railroad.  We were very anxious to get to that road, and even
round to the South Side Railroad if possible.</p>

<p>Meade moved Hancock's corps, now commanded by Birney, to the
left, with a view to at least force the enemy to stay within the
limits of his own line.  General Wright, with the 6th corps, was
ordered by a road farther south, to march directly for the
Weldon road.  The enemy passed in between these two corps and
attacked vigorously, and with very serious results to the
National troops, who were then withdrawn from their advanced
position.</p>

<p>The Army of the Potomac was given the investment of Petersburg,
while the Army of the James held Bermuda Hundred and all the
ground we possessed north of the James River.  The 9th corps,
Burnside's, was placed upon the right at Petersburg; the 5th,
Warren's, next; the 2d, Birney's, next; then the 6th, Wright's,
broken off to the left and south.  Thus began the siege of
Petersburg.</p>

BEFORE PETERSBURG&mdash;EXPLOSION OF THE MINE BEFORE
PETERSBURG&mdash;CAMPAIGN IN THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY&mdash;CAPTURE OF THE

<br>

<p>On the 7th of June, while at Cold Harbor, I had as already
indicated sent Sheridan with two divisions of cavalry to destroy
as much as he could of the Virginia Central Railroad.  General
Hunter had been operating up the Shenandoah Valley with some
success, having fought a battle near Staunton where he captured
a great many prisoners, besides killing and wounding a good many
men.  After the battle he formed a junction at Staunton with
Averell and Crook, who had come up from the Kanawha, or Gauley
River.  It was supposed, therefore, that General Hunter would be
about Charlottesville, Virginia, by the time Sheridan could get
there, doing on the way the damage that he was sent to do.</p>

<p>I gave Sheridan instructions to have Hunter, in case he should
meet him about Charlottesville, join and return with him to the
Army of the Potomac.  Lee, hearing of Hunter's success in the
valley, started Breckinridge out for its defence at once.
Learning later of Sheridan's going with two divisions, he also
sent Hampton with two divisions of cavalry, his own and
Fitz-Hugh Lee's.</p>

<p>Sheridan moved to the north side of the North Anna to get out
west, and learned of the movement of these troops to the south
side of the same stream almost as soon as they had started. He
pushed on to get to Trevilian Station to commence his
destruction at that point.  On the night of the 10th he
bivouacked some six or seven miles east of Trevilian, while
Fitz-Hugh Lee was the same night at Trevilian Station and
Hampton but a few miles away.</p>

<p>During the night Hampton ordered an advance on Sheridan, hoping,
no doubt, to surprise and very badly cripple him.  Sheridan,
however, by a counter move sent Custer on a rapid march to get
between the two divisions of the enemy and into their rear. This
he did successfully, so that at daylight, when the assault was
made, the enemy found himself at the same time resisted in front
and attacked in rear, and broke in some confusion.  The losses
were probably very light on both sides in killed and wounded,
but Sheridan got away with some five hundred prisoners and sent
them to City Point.</p>

<p>During that day, the 11th, Sheridan moved into Trevilian
Station, and the following day proceeded to tear up the road
east and west.  There was considerable fighting during the whole
of the day, but the work of destruction went on.  In the
meantime, at night, the enemy had taken possession of the
crossing which Sheridan had proposed to take to go north when he
left Trevilian.  Sheridan learned, however, from some of the
prisoners he had captured here, that General Hunter was about
Lynchburg, and therefore that there was no use of his going on
to Charlottesville with a view to meet him.</p>

<p>Sheridan started back during the night of the 12th, and made his
way north and farther east, coming around by the north side of
White House, and arriving there on the 21st.  Here he found an
abundance of forage for his animals, food for his men, and
security while resting.  He had been obliged to leave about
ninety of his own men in the field-hospital which he had
established near Trevilian, and these necessarily fell into the
hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>White House up to this time had been a depot; but now that our
troops were all on the James River, it was no longer wanted as a
store of supplies.  Sheridan was, therefore, directed to break it
up; which he did on the 22d of June, bringing the garrison and an
immense wagon train with him.  All these were over the James
River by the 26th of the month, and Sheridan ready to follow.</p>

<p>In the meantime Meade had sent Wilson's division on a raid to
destroy the Weldon and South Side roads.  Now that Sheridan was
safe and Hampton free to return to Richmond with his cavalry,
Wilson's position became precarious.  Meade therefore, on the
27th, ordered Sheridan over the river to make a demonstration in
favor of Wilson.  Wilson got back, though not without severe
loss, having struck both roads, but the damage done was soon
repaired.</p>

<p>After these events comparative quiet reigned about Petersburg
until late in July.  The time, however, was spent in
strengthening the intrenchments and making our position
generally more secure against a sudden attack.  In the meantime
I had to look after other portions of my command, where things
had not been going on so favorably, always, as I could have
wished.</p>

<p>General Hunter who had been appointed to succeed Sigel in the
Shenandoah Valley immediately took up the offensive.  He met the
enemy on the 5th of June at Piedmont, and defeated him.  On the
8th he formed a junction with Crook and Averell at Staunton,
from which place he moved direct on Lynchburg, via Lexington,
which he reached and invested on the 16th.  Up to this time he
was very successful; and but for the difficulty of taking with
him sufficient ordnance stores over so long a march, through a
hostile country, he would, no doubt, have captured Lynchburg.
The destruction of the enemy's supplies and manufactories had
been very great.  To meet this movement under General Hunter,
General Lee sent Early with his corps, a part of which reached
Lynchburg before Hunter.  After some skirmishing on the 17th and
18th, General Hunter, owing to a want of ammunition to give
battle, retired from before the place.  Unfortunately, this want
of ammunition left him no choice of route for his return but by
the way of the Gauley and Kanawha rivers, thence up the Ohio
River, returning to Harper's Ferry by way of the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad.  A long time was consumed in making this
movement.  Meantime the valley was left open to Early's troops,
and others in that quarter; and Washington also was uncovered.
Early took advantage of this condition of affairs and moved on
Washington.</p>

<p>In the absence of Hunter, General Lew Wallace, with headquarters
at Baltimore, commanded the department in which the Shenandoah
lay.  His surplus of troops with which to move against the enemy
was small in number.  Most of these were raw and, consequently,
very much inferior to our veterans and to the veterans which
Early had with him; but the situation of Washington was
precarious, and Wallace moved with commendable promptitude to
meet the enemy at the Monocacy.  He could hardly have expected
to defeat him badly, but he hoped to cripple and delay him until
Washington could be put into a state of preparation for his
reception.  I had previously ordered General Meade to send a
division to Baltimore for the purpose of adding to the defences
of Washington, and he had sent Ricketts's division of the 6th
corps (Wright's), which arrived in Baltimore on the 8th of
July.  Finding that Wallace had gone to the front with his
command, Ricketts immediately took the cars and followed him to
the Monocacy with his entire division.  They met the enemy and,
as might have been expected, were defeated; but they succeeded
in stopping him for the day on which the battle took place.  The
next morning Early started on his march to the capital of the
Nation, arriving before it on the 11th.</p>

<p>Learning of the gravity of the situation I had directed General
Meade to also order Wright with the rest of his corps directly
to Washington for the relief of that place, and the latter
reached there the very day that Early arrived before it.  The
19th corps, which had been stationed in Louisiana, having been
ordered up to reinforce the armies about Richmond, had about
this time arrived at Fortress Monroe, on their way to join us. I
diverted them from that point to Washington, which place they
reached, almost simultaneously with Wright, on the 11th.  The
19th corps was commanded by Major-General Emory.</p>

<p>Early made his reconnoissance with a view of attacking on the
following morning, the 12th; but the next morning he found our
intrenchments, which were very strong, fully manned.  He at once
commenced to retreat, Wright following.  There is no telling how
much this result was contributed to by General Lew Wallace's
leading what might well be considered almost a forlorn hope.  If
Early had been but one day earlier he might have entered the
capital before the arrival of the reinforcements I had sent.
Whether the delay caused by the battle amounted to a day or not,
General Wallace contributed on this occasion, by the defeat of
the troops under him a greater benefit to the cause than often
falls to the lot of a commander of an equal force to render by
means of a victory.</p>

<p>Farther west also the troubles were threatening.  Some time
before, Forrest had met Sturgis in command of some of our
cavalry in Mississippi and handled him very roughly, gaining a
very great victory over him.  This left Forrest free to go
almost where he pleased, and to cut the roads in rear of Sherman
who was then advancing.  Sherman was abundantly able to look
after the army that he was immediately with, and all of his
military division so long as he could communicate with it; but
it was my place to see that he had the means with which to hold
his rear.  Two divisions under A. J. Smith had been sent to
Banks in Louisiana some months before.  Sherman ordered these
back, with directions to attack Forrest.  Smith met and defeated
him very badly.  I then directed that Smith should hang to
Forrest and not let him go; and to prevent by all means his
getting upon the Memphis and Nashville Railroad.  Sherman had
anticipated me in this matter, and given the same orders in
substance; but receiving my directions for this order to Smith,
he repeated it.</p>

<p>On the 25th of June General Burnside had commenced running a
mine from about the centre of his front under the Confederate
works confronting him.  He was induced to do this by Colonel
Pleasants, of the Pennsylvania Volunteers, whose regiment was
mostly composed of miners, and who was himself a practical
miner.  Burnside had submitted the scheme to Meade and myself,
and we both approved of it, as a means of keeping the men
occupied.  His position was very favorable for carrying on this
work, but not so favorable for the operations to follow its
completion.  The position of the two lines at that point were
only about a hundred yards apart with a comparatively deep
ravine intervening.  In the bottom of this ravine the work
commenced.  The position was unfavorable in this particular:
that the enemy's line at that point was re-entering, so that its
front was commanded by their own lines both to the right and
left.  Then, too, the ground was sloping upward back of the
Confederate line for a considerable distance, and it was
presumable that the enemy had, at least, a detached work on this
highest point.  The work progressed, and on the 23d of July the
mine was finished ready for charging; but I had this work of
charging deferred until we were ready for it.</p>

<br><br>

<p>On the 17th of July several deserters came in and said that
there was great consternation in Richmond, and that Lee was
coming out to make an attack upon us the object being to put us
on the defensive so that he might detach troops to go to Georgia
where the army Sherman was operating against was said to be in
great trouble.  I put the army commanders, Meade and Butler, on
the lookout, but the attack was not made.</p>

<p>I concluded, then, a few days later, to do something in the way
of offensive movement myself, having in view something of the
same object that Lee had had.  Wright's and Emory's corps were
in Washington, and with this reduction of my force Lee might
very readily have spared some troops from the defences to send
West.  I had other objects in view, however, besides keeping Lee
where he was.  The mine was constructed and ready to be exploded,
and I wanted to take that occasion to carry Petersburg if I
could.  It was the object, therefore, to get as many of Lee's
troops away from the south side of the James River as
possible.  Accordingly, on the 26th, we commenced a movement
with Hancock's corps and Sheridan's cavalry to the north side by
the way of Deep Bottom, where Butler had a pontoon bridge laid.
The plan, in the main, was to let the cavalry cut loose and,
joining with Kautz's cavalry of the Army of the James, get by
Lee's lines and destroy as much as they could of the Virginia
Central Railroad, while, in the mean time, the infantry was to
move out so as to protect their rear and cover their retreat
back when they should have got through with their work.  We were
successful in drawing the enemy's troops to the north side of the
James as I expected.  The mine was ordered to be charged, and the
morning of the 30th of July was the time fixed for its
explosion.  I gave Meade minute orders on the 24th
directing how I wanted the assault conducted, which orders he
amplified into general instructions for the guidance of the
troops that were to be engaged.</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<br>CITY POINT, VA., July 24, 1864.

<br><br>MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,
<br>Commanding, etc.

<br><br>The engineer officers who made a survey of the front from
Bermuda Hundred report against the probability of success from
an attack there.  The chances they think will be better on
Burnside's front.  If this is attempted it will be necessary to
concentrate all the force possible at the point in the enemy's
line we expect to penetrate.  All officers should be fully
impressed with the absolute necessity of pushing entirely beyond
the enemy's present line, if they should succeed in penetrating
it, and of getting back to their present line promptly if they
should not succeed in breaking through.

<br><br>To the right and left of the point of assault all the artillery
possible should be brought to play upon the enemy in front
during the assault.  Their lines would be sufficient for the
support of the artillery, and all the reserves could be brought
on the flanks of their commands nearest to the point of assault,
ready to follow in if successful.  The field artillery and
infantry held in the lines during the first assault should be in
readiness to move at a moment's notice either to their front or
to follow the main assault, as they should receive orders.  One
thing, however, should be impressed on corps commanders.  If
they see the enemy giving away on their front or moving from it
to reinforce a heavily assaulted portion of their line, they
should take advantage of such knowledge and act promptly without
waiting for orders from army commanders.  General Ord can
co-operate with his corps in this movement, and about five
thousand troops from Bermuda Hundred can be sent to reinforce
you or can be used to threaten an assault between the Appomattox
and James rivers, as may be deemed best.

<br><br>This should be done by Tuesday morning, if done at all.  If not
attempted, we will then start at the date indicated to destroy
the railroad as far as Hicksford at least, and to Weldon if
possible.

<br><br>Whether we send an expedition on the road or assault at
Petersburg, Burnside's mine will be blown up....

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.

<p>Meade's instructions, which I, of course, approved most
heartily, were all that I can see now was necessary.  The only
further precaution which he could have taken, and which he could
not foresee, would have been to have different men to execute
them.</p>

<p>The gallery to the mine was over five hundred feet long from
where it entered the ground to the point where it was under the
enemy's works, and with a cross gallery of something over eighty
feet running under their lines.  Eight chambers had been left,
requiring a ton of powder each to charge them.  All was ready by
the time I had prescribed; and on the 29th Hancock and Sheridan
were brought back near the James River with their troops.  Under
cover of night they started to recross the bridge at Deep Bottom,
and to march directly for that part of our lines in front of the
mine.</p>

<p>Warren was to hold his line of intrenchments with a sufficient
number of men and concentrate the balance on the right next to
Burnside's corps, while Ord, now commanding the 18th corps,
temporarily under Meade, was to form in the rear of Burnside to
support him when he went in.  All were to clear off the parapets
and the _abatis_ in their front so as to leave the space as open
as possible, and be able to charge the moment the mine had been
sprung and Burnside had taken possession.  Burnside's corps was
not to stop in the crater at all but push on to the top of the
hill, supported on the right and left by Ord's and Warren's
corps.</p>

<p>Warren and Ord fulfilled their instructions perfectly so far as
making ready was concerned.  Burnside seemed to have paid no
attention whatever to the instructions, and left all the
obstruction in his own front for his troops to get over in the
best way they could.  The four divisions of his corps were
commanded by Generals Potter, Willcox, Ledlie and Ferrero.  The
last was a colored division; and Burnside selected it to make
the assault.  Meade interfered with this.  Burnside then took
Ledlie's division&mdash;a worse selection than the first could have
been.  In fact, Potter and Willcox were the only division
commanders Burnside had who were equal to the occasion.  Ledlie
besides being otherwise inefficient, proved also to possess
disqualification less common among soldiers.</p>

<p>There was some delay about the explosion of the mine so that it
did not go off until about five o'clock in the morning.  When it
did explode it was very successful, making a crater twenty feet
deep and something like a hundred feet in length.  Instantly one
hundred and ten cannon and fifty mortars, which had been placed
in the most commanding positions covering the ground to the
right and left of where the troops were to enter the enemy's
lines, commenced playing.  Ledlie's division marched into the
crater immediately on the explosion, but most of the men stopped
there in the absence of any one to give directions; their
commander having found some safe retreat to get into before they
started.  There was some delay on the left and right in
advancing, but some of the troops did get in and turn to the
right and left, carrying the rifle-pits as I expected they would
do.</p>

<p>There had been great consternation in Petersburg, as we were
well aware, about a rumored mine that we were going to
explode.  They knew we were mining, and they had failed to cut
our mine off by countermining, though Beauregard had taken the
precaution to run up a line of intrenchments to the rear of that
part of their line fronting where they could see that our men
were at work.  We had learned through deserters who had come in
that the people had very wild rumors about what was going on on
our side.  They said that we had undermined the whole of
Petersburg; that they were resting upon a slumbering volcano and
did not know at what moment they might expect an eruption.  I
somewhat based my calculations upon this state of feeling, and
expected that when the mine was exploded the troops to the right
and left would flee in all directions, and that our troops, if
they moved promptly, could get in and strengthen themselves
before the enemy had come to a realization of the true
situation.  It was just as I expected it would be.  We could see
the men running without any apparent object except to get away.
It was half an hour before musketry firing, to amount to
anything, was opened upon our men in the crater.  It was an hour
before the enemy got artillery up to play upon them; and it was
nine o'clock before Lee got up reinforcements from his right to
join in expelling our troops.</p>

<p>The effort was a stupendous failure.  It cost us about four
thousand men, mostly, however, captured; and all due to
inefficiency on the part of the corps commander and the
incompetency of the division commander who was sent to lead the
assault.</p>

<p>After being fully assured of the failure of the mine, and
finding that most of that part of Lee's army which had been
drawn north of the James River were still there, I gave Meade
directions to send a corps of infantry and the cavalry next
morning, before Lee could get his forces back, to destroy
fifteen or twenty miles of the Weldon Railroad.  But misfortunes
never come singly.  I learned during that same afternoon that
Wright's pursuit of Early was feeble because of the constant and
contrary orders he had been receiving from Washington, while I
was cut off from immediate communication by reason of our cable
across Chesapeake Bay being broken.  Early, however, was not
aware of the fact that Wright was not pursuing until he had
reached Strasburg.  Finding that he was not pursued he turned
back to Winchester, where Crook was stationed with a small
force, and drove him out.  He then pushed north until he had
reached the Potomac, then he sent McCausland across to
Chambersburg, Pa., to destroy that town.  Chambersburg was a
purely defenceless town with no garrison whatever, and no
fortifications; yet McCausland, under Early's orders, burned the
place and left about three hundred families houseless.  This
occurred on the 30th of July.  I rescinded my orders for the
troops to go out to destroy the Weldon Railroad, and directed
them to embark for Washington City.  After burning Chambersburg
McCausland retreated, pursued by our cavalry, towards
Cumberland.  They were met and defeated by General Kelley and
driven into Virginia.</p>

<p>The Shenandoah Valley was very important to the Confederates,
because it was the principal storehouse they now had for feeding
their armies about Richmond.  It was well known that they would
make a desperate struggle to maintain it.  It had been the
source of a great deal of trouble to us heretofore to guard that
outlet to the north, partly because of the incompetency of some
of the commanders, but chiefly because of interference from
Washington.</p>

<p>It seemed to be the policy of General Halleck and Secretary
Stanton to keep any force sent there, in pursuit of the invading
army, moving right and left so as to keep between the enemy and
our capital; and, generally speaking, they pursued this policy
until all knowledge of the whereabouts of the enemy was lost.
They were left, therefore, free to supply themselves with
horses, beef cattle, and such provisions as they could carry
away from Western Maryland and Pennsylvania.  I determined to
put a stop to this.  I started Sheridan at once for that field
of operation, and on the following day sent another division of
his cavalry.</p>

<p>I had previously asked to have Sheridan assigned to that
command, but Mr. Stanton objected, on the ground that he was too
young for so important a command.  On the 1st of August when I
sent reinforcements for the protection of Washington, I sent the
following orders:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
CITY POINT, VA.,</p>

<p>August 1, 1864, 11.30 A.M.</p>

<p>MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK,
<br>Washington D. C.</p>

<p>I am sending General Sheridan for temporary duty whilst the
enemy is being expelled from the border.  Unless General Hunter
is in the field in person, I want Sheridan put in command of all
the troops in the field, with instructions to put himself south
of the enemy and follow him to the death.  Wherever the enemy
goes let our troops go also.  Once started up the valley they
ought to be followed until we get possession of the Virginia
Central Railroad.  If General Hunter is in the field, give
Sheridan direct command of the 6th corps and cavalry division.
All the cavalry, I presume, will reach Washington in the course
of to-morrow.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
The President in some way or other got to see this dispatch of
mine directing certain instructions to be given to the
commanders in the field, operating against Early, and sent me
the following very characteristic dispatch:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
OFFICE U. S. MILITARY TELEGRAPH,
<br>WAR DEPARTMENT,
<br>WASHINGTON, D. C., August 3, 1864.</p>

<p>Cypher. 6 P.M.,</p>

<p>LT. GENERAL GRANT,
<br>City Point, Va.</p>

<p>I have seen your despatch in which you say, "I want Sheridan put
in command of all the troops in the field, with instructions to
put himself south of the enemy, and follow him to the death.
Wherever the enemy goes, let our troops go also."  This, I
think, is exactly right, as to how our forces should move.  But
please look over the despatches you may have received from here,
even since you made that order, and discover, if you can, that
there is any idea in the head of any one here, of "putting our
army south of the enemy," or of "following him to the death" in
any direction.  I repeat to you it will neither be done nor
attempted unless you watch it every day, and hour, and force it.</p>

<p>A. LINCOLN.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
I replied to this that "I would start in two hours for
Washington," and soon got off, going directly to the Monocacy
without stopping at Washington on my way.  I found General
Hunter's army encamped there, scattered over the fields along
the banks of the Monocacy, with many hundreds of cars and
locomotives, belonging to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which
he had taken the precaution to bring back and collect at that
point.  I asked the general where the enemy was.  He replied
that he did not know.  He said the fact was, that he was so
embarrassed with orders from Washington moving him first to the
right and then to the left that he had lost all trace of the
enemy.</p>

<p>I then told the general that I would find out where the enemy
was, and at once ordered steam got up and trains made up, giving
directions to push for Halltown, some four miles above Harper's
Ferry, in the Shenandoah Valley.  The cavalry and the wagon
trains were to march, but all the troops that could be
transported by the cars were to go in that way.  I knew that the
valley was of such importance to the enemy that, no matter how
much he was scattered at that time, he would in a very short
time be found in front of our troops moving south.</p>

<p>I then wrote out General Hunter's instructions. [See letter, August 5th, Appendix.]
I told him that Sheridan was in Washington, and still another division
was on its way; and suggested that he establish the headquarters
of the department at any point that would suit him best,
Cumberland, Baltimore, or elsewhere, and give Sheridan command
of the troops in the field.  The general replied to this, that
he thought he had better be relieved entirely.  He said that
General Halleck seemed so much to distrust his fitness for the
position he was in that he thought somebody else ought to be
there.  He did not want, in any way, to embarrass the cause;
thus showing a patriotism that was none too common in the
army.  There were not many major-generals who would voluntarily
have asked to have the command of a department taken from them
on the supposition that for some particular reason, or for any
reason, the service would be better performed.  I told him,
"very well then," and telegraphed at once for Sheridan to come
to the Monocacy, and suggested that I would wait and meet him
there.</p>

<p>Sheridan came at once by special train, but reached there after
the troops were all off.  I went to the station and remained
there until he arrived.  Myself and one or two of my staff were
about all the Union people, except General Hunter and his staff,
who were left at the Monocacy when Sheridan arrived.  I hastily
told Sheridan what had been done and what I wanted him to do,
giving him, at the same time, the written instructions which had
been prepared for General Hunter and directed to that officer.</p>

<p>Sheridan now had about 30,000 men to move with, 8,000 of them
being cavalry.  Early had about the same number, but the
superior ability of the National commander over the Confederate
commander was so great that all the latter's advantage of being
on the defensive was more than counterbalanced by this
circumstance.  As I had predicted, Early was soon found in front
of Sheridan in the valley, and Pennsylvania and Maryland were
speedily freed from the invaders.  The importance of the valley
was so great to the Confederates that Lee reinforced Early, but
not to the extent that we thought and feared he would.</p>

<p>To prevent as much as possible these reinforcements from being
sent out from Richmond, I had to do something to compel Lee to
retain his forces about his capital.  I therefore gave orders
for another move to the north side of the James River, to
threaten Richmond.  Hancock's corps, part of the 10th corps
under Birney, and Gregg's division of cavalry were crossed to
the north side of the James during the night of the 13th-14th of
August.  A threatening position was maintained for a number of
days, with more or less skirmishing, and some tolerably hard
fighting; although it was my object and my instructions that
anything like a battle should be avoided, unless opportunities
should present themselves which would insure great success.
General Meade was left in command of the few troops around
Petersburg, strongly intrenched; and was instructed to keep a
close watch upon the enemy in that quarter, and himself to take
advantage of any weakening that might occur through an effort on
the part of the enemy to reinforce the north side.  There was no
particular victory gained on either side; but during that time
no more reinforcements were sent to the valley.</p>

<p>I informed Sheridan of what had been done to prevent
reinforcements being sent from Richmond against him, and also
that the efforts we had made had proven that one of the
divisions which we supposed had gone to the valley was still at
Richmond, because we had captured six or seven hundred prisoners
from that division, each of its four brigades having contributed
to our list of captures.  I also informed him that but one
division had gone, and it was possible that I should be able to
prevent the going of any more.</p>

<p>To add to my embarrassment at this time Sherman, who was now
near Atlanta, wanted reinforcements.  He was perfectly willing
to take the raw troops then being raised in the North-west,
saying that he could teach them more soldiering in one day among
his troops than they would learn in a week in a camp of
instruction.  I therefore asked that all troops in camps of
instruction in the North-west be sent to him.  Sherman also
wanted to be assured that no Eastern troops were moving out
against him.  I informed him of what I had done and assured him
that I would hold all the troops there that it was possible for
me to hold, and that up to that time none had gone.  I also
informed him that his real danger was from Kirby Smith, who
commanded the trans-Mississippi Department.  If Smith should
escape Steele, and get across the Mississippi River, he might
move against him.  I had, therefore, asked to have an expedition
ready to move from New Orleans against Mobile in case Kirby Smith
should get across.  This would have a tendency to draw him to the
defence of that place, instead of going against Sherman.</p>

<p>Right in the midst of all these embarrassments Halleck informed
me that there was an organized scheme on foot in the North to
resist the draft, and suggested that it might become necessary
to draw troops from the field to put it down.  He also advised
taking in sail, and not going too fast.</p>

<p>The troops were withdrawn from the north side of the James River
on the night of the 20th.  Before they were withdrawn, however,
and while most of Lee's force was on that side of the river,
Warren had been sent with most of the 5th corps to capture the
Weldon Railroad.  He took up his line of march well back to the
rear, south of the enemy, while the troops remaining in the
trenches extended so as to cover that part of the line which he
had vacated by moving out.  From our left, near the old line, it
was about three miles to the Weldon Railroad.  A division was
ordered from the right of the Petersburg line to reinforce
Warren, while a division was brought back from the north side of
the James River to take its place.</p>

<p>This road was very important to the enemy.  The limits from
which his supplies had been drawn were already very much
contracted, and I knew that he must fight desperately to protect
it.  Warren carried the road, though with heavy loss on both
sides.  He fortified his new position, and our trenches were
then extended from the left of our main line to connect with his
new one.  Lee made repeated attempts to dislodge Warren's corps,
but without success, and with heavy loss.</p>

<p>As soon as Warren was fortified and reinforcements reached him,
troops were sent south to destroy the bridges on the Weldon
Railroad; and with such success that the enemy had to draw in
wagons, for a distance of about thirty miles, all the supplies
they got thereafter from that source.  It was on the 21st that
Lee seemed to have given up the Weldon Railroad as having been
lost to him; but along about the 24th or 25th he made renewed
attempts to recapture it; again he failed and with very heavy
losses to him as compared with ours.</p>

<p>On the night of the 20th our troops on the north side of the
James were withdrawn, and Hancock and Gregg were sent south to
destroy the Weldon Railroad.  They were attacked on the 25th at
Reams's Station, and after desperate fighting a part of our line
gave way, losing five pieces of artillery.  But the Weldon
Railroad never went out of our possession from the 18th of
August to the close of the war.</p>

<center><h3>SHERIDAN'S ADVANCE&mdash;VISIT TO SHERIDAN&mdash;SHERIDAN'S VICTORY IN THE
SHENANDOAH&mdash;SHERIDAN'S RIDE TO WINCHESTER&mdash;CLOSE OF THE CAMPAIGN
FOR THE WINTER.</h3></center>
<br>

<p>We had our troops on the Weldon Railroad contending against a
large force that regarded this road of so much importance that
they could afford to expend many lives in retaking it; Sherman
just getting through to Atlanta with great losses of men from
casualties, discharges and detachments left along as guards to
occupy and hold the road in rear of him; Washington threatened
but a short time before, and now Early being strengthened in the
valley so as, probably, to renew that attempt.  It kept me pretty
active in looking after all these points.</p>

<p>On the 10th of August Sheridan had advanced on Early up the
Shenandoah Valley, Early falling back to Strasburg.  On the 12th
I learned that Lee had sent twenty pieces of artillery, two
divisions of infantry and a considerable cavalry force to
strengthen Early.  It was important that Sheridan should be
informed of this, so I sent the information to Washington by
telegraph, and directed a courier to be sent from there to get
the message to Sheridan at all hazards, giving him the
information.  The messenger, an officer of the army, pushed
through with great energy and reached Sheridan just in time. The
officer went through by way of Snicker's Gap, escorted by some
cavalry.  He found Sheridan just making his preparations to
attack Early in his chosen position.  Now, however, he was
thrown back on the defensive.</p>

<p>On the 15th of September I started to visit General Sheridan in
the Shenandoah Valley.  My purpose was to have him attack Early,
or drive him out of the valley and destroy that source of
supplies for Lee's army.  I knew it was impossible for me to get
orders through Washington to Sheridan to make a move, because
they would be stopped there and such orders as Halleck's caution
(and that of the Secretary of War) would suggest would be given
instead, and would, no doubt, be contradictory to mine.  I
therefore, without stopping at Washington, went directly through
to Charlestown, some ten miles above Harper's Ferry, and waited
there to see General Sheridan, having sent a courier in advance
to inform him where to meet me.</p>

<p>When Sheridan arrived I asked him if he had a map showing the
positions of his army and that of the enemy.  He at once drew
one out of his side pocket, showing all roads and streams, and
the camps of the two armies.  He said that if he had permission
he would move so and so (pointing out how) against the
Confederates, and that he could "whip them."  Before starting I
had drawn up a plan of campaign for Sheridan, which I had
brought with me; but, seeing that he was so clear and so
positive in his views and so confident of success, I said
nothing about this and did not take it out of my pocket.</p>

<p>Sheridan's wagon trains were kept at Harper's Ferry, where all
of his stores were.  By keeping the teams at that place, their
forage did not have to be hauled to them.  As supplies of
ammunition, provisions and rations for the men were wanted,
trains would be made up to deliver the stores to the
commissaries and quartermasters encamped at Winchester.  Knowing
that he, in making preparations to move at a given day, would
have to bring up wagons trains from Harper's Ferry, I asked him
if he could be ready to get off by the following Tuesday.  This
was on Friday.  "O Yes," he said, he "could be off before
daylight on Monday."  I told him then to make the attack at that
time and according to his own plan; and I immediately started to
return to the army about Richmond.  After visiting Baltimore and
Burlington, New Jersey, I arrived at City Point on the 19th.</p>

<p>On the way out to Harper's Ferry I had met Mr. Robert Garrett,
President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.  He seemed very
anxious to know when workmen might be put upon the road again so
as to make repairs and put it in shape for running.  It was a
large piece of property to have standing idle.  I told him I
could not answer then positively but would try and inform him
before a great while.  On my return Mr. Garrett met me again with
the same and I told him I thought that by the Wednesday he might
send his workmen out on his road.  I gave him no further
information however, and he had no suspicion of how I expected
to have the road cleared for his workmen.</p>

<p>Sheridan moved at the time he had fixed upon.  He met Early at the
crossing of Opequon Creek, a most decisive victory&mdash;one which
the country.  Early had invited this attack himself by his bad
generalship and made the victory easy.  He had sent G. T.
Anderson's division east of the Blue Ridge before I went to Harper's
Ferry; and about the time I arrived there he started other
divisions (leaving but two in their camps) to march to
Martinsburg for the purpose destroying the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad at that point.  Early here learned that I had been with
Sheridan and, supposing there was some movement on foot, started
back as soon as he got the information.  But his forces were
separated and, as I have said, he was very badly defeated.  He
fell back to Fisher's Hill, Sheridan following.</p>

<p>The valley is narrow at that point, and Early made another stand
there, behind works which extended across.  But Sheridan turned
both his flanks and again sent him speeding up the valley,
following in hot pursuit.  The pursuit was continued up the
valley to Mount Jackson and New Market.  Sheridan captured about
eleven hundred prisoners and sixteen guns.  The houses which he
passed all along the route were found to be filled with Early's
wounded, and the country swarmed with his deserters.  Finally,
on the 25th, Early turned from the valley eastward, leaving
Sheridan at Harrisonburg in undisputed possession.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<center><a name="b332"></a><img alt="b332.jpg (124K)" src="images/b332.jpg" height="1075" width="617">
</center>
<br><br>
<br><br>

<p>Now one of the main objects of the expedition began to be
accomplished.  Sheridan went to work with his command, gathering
in the crops, cattle, and everything in the upper part of the
valley required by our troops; and especially taking what might
be of use to the enemy.  What he could not take away he
destroyed, so that the enemy would not be invited to come back
there.  I congratulated Sheridan upon his recent great victory
and had a salute of a hundred guns fired in honor of it, the
guns being aimed at the enemy around Petersburg.  I also
notified the other commanders throughout the country, who also
fired salutes in honor of his victory.</p>

<p>I had reason to believe that the administration was a little
afraid to have a decisive battle at that time, for fear it might
go against us and have a bad effect on the November elections.
The convention which had met and made its nomination of the
Democratic candidate for the presidency had declared the war a
failure.  Treason was talked as boldly in Chicago at that
convention as ever been in Charleston.  It was a question
whether the government would then have had the power to make
arrests and punish those who talked treason.  But this decisive
victory was the most effective campaign argument made in the
canvass.</p>

<p>Sheridan, in his pursuit, got beyond where they could hear from
him in Washington, and the President became very much frightened
about him.  He was afraid that the hot pursuit had been a little
like that of General Cass was said to have been, in one of our
Indian wars, when he was an officer of army.  Cass was pursuing
the Indians so closely that the first thing he knew he found
himself in front, and the Indians pursuing him.  The President
was afraid that Sheridan had got on the other side of Early and
that Early was in behind him.  He was afraid that Sheridan was
getting so far away that reinforcements would be sent out from
Richmond to enable Early to beat him.  I replied to the
President that I had taken steps to prevent Lee from sending
reinforcements to Early, by attacking the former where he was.</p>

<p>On the 28th of September, to retain Lee in his position, I sent
Ord with the 18th corps and Birney with the 10th corps to make
an advance on Richmond, to threaten it.  Ord moved with the left
wing up to Chaffin's Bluff; Birney with the 10th corps took a
road farther north; while Kautz with the cavalry took the Darby
road, still farther to the north.  They got across the river by
the next morning, and made an effort to surprise the enemy.  In
that, however, they were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The enemy's lines were very strong and very intricate.
Stannard's division of the 18th corps with General Burnham's
brigade leading, tried an assault against Fort Harrison and
captured it with sixteen guns and a good many prisoners. Burnham
was killed in the assault.  Colonel Stevens who succeeded him was
badly wounded; and his successor also fell in the same way.  Some
works to the right and left were also carried with the guns in
them&mdash;six in number&mdash;and a few more prisoners.  Birney's troops
to the right captured the enemy's intrenched picket-lines, but
were unsuccessful in their efforts upon the main line.</p>

<p>Our troops fortified their new position, bringing Fort Harrison
into the new line and extending it to the river.  This brought
us pretty close to the enemy on the north side of the James, and
the two opposing lines maintained their relative positions to the
close of the siege.</p>

<p>In the afternoon a further attempt was made to advance, but it
failed.  Ord fell badly wounded, and had to be relieved; the
command devolved upon General Heckman, and later General Weitzel
was assigned to the command of the 18th corps.  During the night
Lee reinforced his troops about Fort Gilmer, which was at the
right of Fort Harrison, by eight additional brigades from
Petersburg, and attempted to retake the works which we had
captured by concentrating ten brigades against them.  All their
efforts failed, their attacks being all repulsed with very heavy
loss.  In one of these assaults upon us General Stannard, a
gallant officer who was defending Fort Harrison, lost an arm.
Our casualties during these operations amounted to 394 killed,
I,554 wounded and 324 missing.</p>

<p>Whilst this was going on General Meade was instructed to keep up
an appearance of moving troops to our extreme left.  Parke and
Warren were kept with two divisions, each under arms, ready to
move leaving their enclosed batteries manned, with a scattering
line on the other intrenchments.  The object of this was to
prevent reinforcements from going to the north side of the
river.  Meade was instructed to watch the enemy closely and, if
Lee weakened his lines, to make an attack.</p>

<p>On the 30th these troops moved out, under Warren, and captured
an advanced intrenched camp at Peeble's farm, driving the enemy
back to the main line.  Our troops followed and made an attack
in the hope of carrying the enemy's main line; but in this they
were unsuccessful and lost a large number of men, mostly
captured.  The number of killed and wounded was not large.  The
next day our troops advanced again and established themselves,
intrenching a new line about a mile in front of the enemy.  This
advanced Warren's position on the Weldon Railroad very
considerably.</p>

<p>Sheridan having driven the enemy out of the valley, and taken
the productions of the valley so that instead of going there for
supplies the enemy would have to bring his provisions with him if
he again entered it, recommended a reduction of his own force,
the surplus to be sent where it could be of more use.  I
approved of his suggestion, and ordered him to send Wright's
corps back to the James River.  I further directed him to repair
the railroad up the Shenandoah Valley towards the advanced
position which we would hold with a small force.  The troops
were to be sent to Washington by the way of Culpeper, in order
to watch the east side of the Blue Ridge, and prevent the enemy
from getting into the rear of Sheridan while he was still doing
his work of destruction.</p>

<p>The valley was so very important, however, to the Confederate
army that, contrary to our expectations, they determined to make
one more strike, and save it if possible before the supplies
should be all destroyed.  Reinforcements were sent therefore to
Early, and this before any of our troops had been withdrawn.
Early prepared to strike Sheridan at Harrisonburg; but the
latter had not remained there.</p>

<p>On the 6th of October Sheridan commenced retiring down the
valley, taking or destroying all the food and forage and driving
the cattle before him, Early following.  At Fisher's Hill
Sheridan turned his cavalry back on that of Early, which, under
the lead of Rosser, was pursuing closely, and routed it most
completely, capturing eleven guns and a large number of
prisoners.  Sheridan lost only about sixty men.  His cavalry
pursued the enemy back some twenty-five miles.  On the 10th of
October the march down the valley was again resumed, Early again
following.</p>

<p>I now ordered Sheridan to halt, and to improve the opportunity
if afforded by the enemy's having been sufficiently weakened, to
move back again and cut the James River Canal and Virginia
Central Railroad.  But this order had to go through Washington
where it was intercepted; and when Sheridan received what
purported to be a statement of what I wanted him to do it was
something entirely different.  Halleck informed Sheridan that it
was my wish for him to hold a forward position as a base from
which to act against Charlottesville and Gordonsville; that he
should fortify this position and provision it.</p>

<p>Sheridan objected to this most decidedly; and I was impelled to
telegraph him, on the 14th, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
CITY POINT, VA.,
<br>October 14, 1864.&mdash;12.30 P.M.</p>

<p>MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN,
<br>Cedar Creek, Va.</p>

<p>What I want is for you to threaten the Virginia Central Railroad
and canal in the manner your judgment tells you is best, holding
yourself ready to advance, if the enemy draw off their forces.
If you make the enemy hold a force equal to your own for the
protection of those thoroughfares, it will accomplish nearly as
much as their destruction.  If you cannot do this, then the next
best thing to do is to send here all the force you can.  I deem a
good cavalry force necessary for your offensive, as well as
defensive operations.  You need not therefore send here more
than one division of cavalry.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
Sheridan having been summoned to Washington City, started on the
15th leaving Wright in command.  His army was then at Cedar
Creek, some twenty miles south of Winchester.  The next morning
while at Front Royal, Sheridan received a dispatch from Wright,
saying that a dispatch from Longstreet to Early had been
intercepted.  It directed the latter to be ready to move and to
crush Sheridan as soon as he, Longstreet, arrived.  On the
receipt of this news Sheridan ordered the cavalry up the valley
to join Wright.</p>

<p>On the 18th of October Early was ready to move, and during the
night succeeded in getting his troops in the rear of our left
flank, which fled precipitately and in great confusion down the
valley, losing eighteen pieces of artillery and a thousand or
more prisoners.  The right under General Getty maintained a firm
and steady front, falling back to Middletown where it took a
position and made a stand.  The cavalry went to the rear, seized
the roads leading to Winchester and held them for the use of our
troops in falling back, General Wright having ordered a retreat
back to that place.</p>

<p>Sheridan having left Washington on the 18th, reached Winchester
that night.  The following morning he started to join his
command.  He had scarcely got out of town, when he met his men
returning in panic from the front and also heard heavy firing to
the south.  He immediately ordered the cavalry at Winchester to
be deployed across the valley to stop the stragglers.  Leaving
members of his staff to take care of Winchester and the public
property there, he set out with a small escort directly for the
scene of battle.  As he met the fugitives he ordered them to
turn back, reminding them that they were going the wrong way.
His presence soon restored confidence.  Finding themselves worse
frightened than hurt the men did halt and turn back.  Many of
those who had run ten miles got back in time to redeem their
reputation as gallant soldiers before night.</p>

<p>When Sheridan got to the front he found Getty and Custer still
holding their ground firmly between the Confederates and our
retreating troops.  Everything in the rear was now ordered up.
Sheridan at once proceeded to intrench his position; and he
awaited an assault from the enemy.  This was made with vigor,
and was directed principally against Emory's corps, which had
sustained the principal loss in the first attack.  By one
o'clock the attack was repulsed.  Early was so badly damaged
that he seemed disinclined to make another attack, but went to
work to intrench himself with a view to holding the position he
had already gained.  He thought, no doubt, that Sheridan would
be glad enough to leave him unmolested; but in this he was
mistaken.</p>

<p>About the middle of the afternoon Sheridan advanced.  He sent
his cavalry by both flanks, and they penetrated to the enemy's
rear.  The contest was close for a time, but at length the left
of the enemy broke, and disintegration along the whole line soon
followed.  Early tried to rally his men, but they were followed
so closely that they had to give way very quickly every time
they attempted to make a stand.  Our cavalry, having pushed on
and got in the rear of the Confederates, captured twenty-four
pieces of artillery, besides retaking what had been lost in the
morning.  This victory pretty much closed the campaigning in the
Valley of Virginia.  All the Confederate troops were sent back to
Richmond with the exception of one division of infantry and a
little cavalry.  Wright's corps was ordered back to the Army of
the Potomac, and two other divisions were withdrawn from the
valley.  Early had lost more men in killed, wounded and captured
in the valley than Sheridan had commanded from first to last.</p>

<p>On more than one occasion in these engagements General R. B.
Hayes, who succeeded me as President of the United States, bore
a very honorable part.  His conduct on the field was marked by
conspicuous gallantry as well as the display of qualities of a
higher order than that of mere personal daring.  This might well
have been expected of one who could write at the time he is said
to have done so:  "Any officer fit for duty who at this crisis
would abandon his post to electioneer for a seat in Congress,
ought to be scalped."  Having entered the army as a Major of
Volunteers at the beginning of the war, General Hayes attained
by meritorious service the rank of Brevet Major-General before
its close.</p>

<p>On the north side of the James River the enemy attacked Kautz's
cavalry on the 7th of October, and drove it back with heavy loss
in killed, wounded and prisoners, and the loss of all the
artillery.  This was followed up by an attack on our intrenched
infantry line, but was repulsed with severe slaughter.  On the
13th a reconnoissance was sent out by General Butler, with a
view to drive the enemy from some new works he was constructing,
which resulted in heavy loss to us.</p>

<p>On the 24th I ordered General Meade to attempt to get possession
of the South Side Railroad, and for that purpose to advance on
the 27th.  The attempt proved a failure, however, the most
advanced of our troops not getting nearer than within six miles
of the point aimed for.  Seeing the impossibility of its
accomplishment I ordered the troops to withdraw, and they were
all back in their former positions the next day.</p>

<p>Butler, by my directions, also made a demonstration on the north
side of the James River in order to support this move, by
detaining there the Confederate troops who were on that side. He
succeeded in this, but failed of further results by not marching
past the enemy's left before turning in on the Darby road and by
reason of simply coming up against their lines in place.</p>

<p>This closed active operations around Richmond for the winter. Of
course there was frequent skirmishing between pickets, but no
serious battle was fought near either Petersburg or Richmond.
It would prolong this work to give a detailed account of all
that took place from day to day around Petersburg and at other
parts of my command, and it would not interest the general
reader if given.  All these details can be found by the military
student in a series of books published by the Scribners, Badeau's
history of my campaigns, and also in the publications of the War
Department, including both the National and Confederate reports.</p>

<p>In the latter part of November General Hancock was relieved from
the command of the 2d corps by the Secretary of War and ordered
to Washington, to organize and command a corps of veteran troops
to be designated the 1st corps.  It was expected that this would
give him a large command to co-operate with in the spring.  It
was my expectation, at the time, that in the final operations
Hancock should move either up the valley, or else east of the
Blue Ridge to Lynchburg; the idea being to make the spring
campaign the close of the war.  I expected, with Sherman coming
up from the South, Meade south of Petersburg and around
Richmond, and Thomas's command in Tennessee with depots of
supplies established in the eastern part of that State, to move
from the direction of Washington or the valley towards
Lynchburg.  We would then have Lee so surrounded that his
supplies would be cut off entirely, making it impossible for him
to support his army.</p>

<p>General Humphreys, chief-of-staff of the Army of the Potomac,
was assigned to the command of the 2d corps, to succeed Hancock.</p>

<a name="ch59"></a><center><h2>CHAPTER LIX.</h2></center>

<center><h3>THE CAMPAIGN IN GEORGIA&mdash;SHERMAN'S MARCH TO THE SEA&mdash;WAR
ANECDOTES&mdash;THE MARCH ON SAVANNAH&mdash;INVESTMENT OF
SAVANNAH&mdash;CAPTURE OF SAVANNAH.</h3></center>
<br>

<p>Let us now return to the operations in the military division of
the Mississippi, and accompany Sherman in his march to the sea.</p>

<p>The possession of Atlanta by us narrowed the territory of the
enemy very materially and cut off one of his two remaining lines
of roads from east to west.</p>

<p>A short time after the fall of Atlanta Mr. Davis visited
Palmetto and Macon and made speeches at each place.  He spoke at
Palmetto on the 20th of September, and at Macon on the 22d.
Inasmuch as he had relieved Johnston and appointed Hood, and
Hood had immediately taken the initiative, it is natural to
suppose that Mr. Davis was disappointed with General Johnston's
policy.  My own judgment is that Johnston acted very wisely:  he
husbanded his men and saved as much of his territory as he could,
without fighting decisive battles in which all might be lost.  As
Sherman advanced, as I have show, his army became spread out,
until, if this had been continued, it would have been easy to
destroy it in detail.  I know that both Sherman and I were
rejoiced when we heard of the change.  Hood was unquestionably a
brave, gallant soldier and not destitute of ability; but
unfortunately his policy was to fight the enemy wherever he saw
him, without thinking much of the consequences of defeat.</p>

<p>In his speeches Mr. Davis denounced Governor Brown, of Georgia,
and General Johnston in unmeasured terms, even insinuating that
their loyalty to the Southern cause was doubtful.  So far as
General Johnston is concerned, I think Davis did him a great
injustice in this particular.  I had know the general before the
war and strongly believed it would be impossible for him to
accept a high commission for the purpose of betraying the cause
he had espoused.  There, as I have said, I think that his policy
was the best one that could have been pursued by the whole
South&mdash;protract the war, which was all that was necessary to
enable them to gain recognition in the end.  The North was
already growing weary, as the South evidently was also, but with
this difference.  In the North the people governed, and could
stop hostilities whenever they chose to stop supplies.  The
South was a military camp, controlled absolutely by the
government with soldiers to back it, and the war could have been
protracted, no matter to what extent the discontent reached, up
to the point of open mutiny of the soldiers themselves.  Mr.
Davis's speeches were frank appeals to the people of Georgia and
that portion of the South to come to their relief.  He tried to
assure his frightened hearers that the Yankees were rapidly
digging their own graves; that measures were already being taken
to cut them off from supplies from the North; and that with a
force in front, and cut off from the rear, they must soon starve
in the midst of a hostile people.  Papers containing reports of
these speeches immediately reached the Northern States, and they
were republished.  Of course, that caused no alarm so long as
telegraphic communication was kept up with Sherman.</p>

<p>When Hood was forced to retreat from Atlanta he moved to the
south-west and was followed by a portion of Sherman's army.  He
soon appeared upon the railroad in Sherman's rear, and with his
whole army began destroying the road.  At the same time also the
work was begun in Tennessee and Kentucky which Mr. Davis had
assured his hearers at Palmetto and Macon would take place.  He
ordered Forrest (about the ablest cavalry general in the South)
north for this purpose; and Forrest and Wheeler carried out
their orders with more or less destruction, occasionally picking
up a garrison.  Forrest indeed performed the very remarkable feat
of capturing, with cavalry, two gunboats and a number of
transports, something the accomplishment of which is very hard
to account for.  Hood's army had been weakened by Governor
Brown's withdrawing the Georgia State troops for the purpose of
gathering in the season's crops for the use of the people and
for the use of the army.  This not only depleted Hood's forces
but it served a most excellent purpose in gathering in supplies
of food and forage for the use of our army in its subsequent
march.  Sherman was obliged to push on with his force and go
himself with portions of it hither and thither, until it was
clearly demonstrated to him that with the army he then had it
would be impossible to hold the line from Atlanta back and leave
him any force whatever with which to take the offensive.  Had
that plan been adhered to, very large reinforcements would have
been necessary; and Mr. Davis's prediction of the destruction of
the army would have been realized, or else Sherman would have
been obliged to make a successful retreat, which Mr. Davis said
in his speeches would prove more disastrous than Napoleon's
retreat from Moscow.</p>

<p>These speeches of Mr. Davis were not long in reaching Sherman.
He took advantage of the information they gave, and made all the
preparation possible for him to make to meet what now became
expected, attempts to break his communications.  Something else
had to be done:  and to Sherman's sensible and soldierly mind
the idea was not long in dawning upon him, not only that
something else had to be done, but what that something else
should be.</p>

<p>On September 10th I telegraphed Sherman as follows:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
CITY POINT, VA., Sept. 10, 1864.</p>

<p>MAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN,
<br>Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p>So soon as your men are sufficiently rested, and preparations
can be made, it is desirable that another campaign should be
commenced.  We want to keep the enemy constantly pressed to the
end of the war.  If we give him no peace whilst the war lasts,
the end cannot be distant.  Now that we have all of Mobile Bay
that is valuable, I do not know but it will be the best move to
transfer Canby's troops to act upon Savannah, whilst you move on
Augusta. I should like to hear from you, however, in this matter.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
Sherman replied promptly:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"If I could be sure of finding provisions and ammunition at
Augusta, or Columbus, Georgia, I can march to Milledgeville, and
compel Hood to give up Augusta or Macon, and then turn on the
other.  ****** If you can manage to take the Savannah River as
high up as Augusta, or the Chattahoochee as far up as Columbus,
I can sweep the whole State of Georgia."</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>On the 12th I sent a special messenger, one of my own staff,
with a letter inviting Sherman's views about the next campaign.</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>CITY POINT, VA., Sept. 12, 1864.</p>

<p>MAJOR-GENERAL W. T.  SHERMAN,
<br>Commanding Mill Division of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>I send Lieutenant-Colonel Porter, of my staff, with this.
Colonel Porter will explain to you the exact condition of
affairs here better than I can do in the limits of a letter.
Although I feel myself strong enough for offensive operations, I
am holding on quietly to get advantage of recruits and
convalescents, who are coming forward very rapidly.  My lines
are necessarily very long, extending from Deep Bottom north of
the James across the peninsula formed by the Appomattox and the
James, and south of the Appomattox to the Weldon Road.  This
line is very strongly fortified, and can be held with
comparatively few men, but from its great length takes many in
the aggregate.  I propose, when I do move, to extend my left so
as to control what is known as the South Side, or Lynchburg and
Petersburg Road, then if possible to keep the Danville Road
cut.  At the same time this move is made, I want to send a force
of from six to ten thousand men against Wilmington.</p>

<p>The way I propose to do this is to land the men north of Fort
Fisher, and hold that point.  At the same time a large naval
fleet will be assembled there, and the iron-clads will run the
batteries as they did at Mobile.  This will give us the same
control of the harbor of Wilmington that we now have of the
harbor of Mobile. What you are to do with the forces at your
command, I do not see. The difficulties of supplying your army,
except when you are constantly moving, beyond where you are, I
plainly see.  If it had not been for Price's movements Canby
would have sent twelve thousand more men to Mobile.  From your
command on the Mississippi an equal number could have been
taken.  With these forces my idea would have been to divide
them, sending one half to Mobile and the other half to
Savannah.  You could then move as proposed in your telegram, so
as to threaten Macon and Augusta equally.  Whichever was
abandoned by the enemy you could take and open up a new base of
supplies.  My object now in sending a staff officer is not so
much to suggest operations for you, as to get your views and
have plans matured by the time everything can be got ready.  It
will probably be the 5th of October before any of the plans
herein indicated will be executed.</p>

<p>If you have any promotions to recommend, send the names forward
and I will approve them. * * *</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.</p>

<p>
This reached Sherman on September 20th.</p>

<p>On the 25th of September Sherman reported to Washington that
Hood's troops were in his rear.  He had provided against this by
sending a division to Chattanooga and a division to Rome,
Georgia, which was in the rear of Hood, supposing that Hood
would fall back in the direction from which he had come to reach
the railroad.  At the same time Sherman and Hood kept up a
correspondence relative to the exchange of prisoners, the
treatment of citizens, and other matters suitable to be arranged
between hostile commanders in the field.  On the 27th of
September I telegraphed Sherman as follows:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
CITY POINT, VA.,
<br>September 27, 1864&mdash;10.30 A.M.</p>

<p>MAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN:</p>

<p>I have directed all recruits and new troops from the Western
States to be sent to Nashville, to receive their further orders
from you.  * * *</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
On the 29th Sherman sent Thomas back to Chattanooga, and
afterwards to Nashville, with another division (Morgan's) of the
advanced army.  Sherman then suggested that, when he was
prepared, his movements should take place against Milledgeville
and then to Savannah.  His expectation at that time was, to make
this movement as soon as he could get up his supplies.  Hood was
moving in his own country, and was moving light so that he could
make two miles to Sherman's one.  He depended upon the country to
gather his supplies, and so was not affected by delays.</p>

<p>As I have said, until this unexpected state of affairs happened,
Mobile had been looked upon as the objective point of Sherman's
army.  It had been a favorite move of mine from 1862, when I
first suggested to the then commander-in-chief that the troops
in Louisiana, instead of frittering away their time in the
trans-Mississippi, should move against Mobile.  I recommended
this from time to time until I came into command of the army,
the last of March 1864.  Having the power in my own hands, I now
ordered the concentration of supplies, stores and troops, in the
department of the Gulf about New Orleans, with a view to a move
against Mobile, in support of, and in conjunction with, the
other armies operating in the field.  Before I came into
command, these troops had been scattered over the
trans-Mississippi department in such a way that they could not
be, or were not, gotten back in time to take any part in the
original movement; hence the consideration, which had caused
Mobile to be selected as the objective point for Sherman's army
to find his next base of supplies after having cut loose from
Atlanta, no longer existed.</p>

<p>General G. M. Dodge, an exceedingly efficient officer, having
been badly wounded, had to leave the army about the first of
October. He was in command of two divisions of the 16th corps,
consolidated into one.  Sherman then divided his army into the
right and left wings the right commanded by General O. O. Howard
and the left by General Slocum.  General Dodge's two divisions
were assigned, one to each of these wings.  Howard's command
embraced the 15th and 17th corps, and Slocum's the 14th and 20th
corps, commanded by Generals Jeff. C. Davis and A. S. Williams.
Generals Logan and Blair commanded the two corps composing the
right wing.  About this time they left to take part in the
presidential election, which took place that year, leaving their
corps to Osterhaus and Ransom.  I have no doubt that their
leaving was at the earnest solicitation of the War Department.
General Blair got back in time to resume his command and to
proceed with it throughout the march to the sea and back to the
grand review at Washington.  General Logan did not return to his
command until after it reached Savannah.</p>

<p>Logan felt very much aggrieved at the transfer of General Howard
from that portion of the Army of the Potomac which was then with
the Western Army, to the command of the Army of the Tennessee,
with which army General Logan had served from the battle of
Belmont to the fall of Atlanta&mdash;having passed successively
through all grades from colonel commanding a regiment to general
commanding a brigade, division and army corps, until upon the
death of McPherson the command of the entire Army of the
Tennessee devolved upon him in the midst of a hotly contested
battle.  He conceived that he had done his full duty as
commander in that engagement; and I can bear testimony, from
personal observation, that he had proved himself fully equal to
all the lower positions which he had occupied as a soldier.  I
will not pretend to question the motive which actuated Sherman
in taking an officer from another army to supersede General
Logan.  I have no doubt, whatever, that he did this for what he
considered would be to the good of the service, which was more
important than that the personal feelings of any individual
should not be aggrieved; though I doubt whether he had an
officer with him who could have filled the place as Logan would
have done.  Differences of opinion must exist between the best
of friends as to policies in war, and of judgment as to men's
fitness.  The officer who has the command, however, should be
allowed to judge of the fitness of the officers under him,
unless he is very manifestly wrong.</p>

<p>Sherman's army, after all the depletions, numbered about sixty
thousand effective men.  All weak men had been left to hold the
rear, and those remaining were not only well men, but strong and
hardy, so that he had sixty thousand as good soldiers as ever
trod the earth; better than any European soldiers, because they
not only worked like a machine but the machine thought.
European armies know very little what they are fighting for, and
care less. Included in these sixty thousand troops, there were
two small divisions of cavalry, numbering altogether about four
thousand men.  Hood had about thirty-five to forty thousand men,
independent of Forrest, whose forces were operating in Tennessee
and Kentucky, as Mr. Davis had promised they should.  This part
of Mr. Davis's military plan was admirable, and promised the
best results of anything he could have done, according to my
judgment. I say this because I have criticised his military
judgment in the removal of Johnston, and also in the appointment
of Hood.  I am aware, however, that there was high feeling
existing at that time between Davis and his subordinate, whom I
regarded as one of his ablest lieutenants.</p>

<p>On the 5th of October the railroad back from Atlanta was again
very badly broken, Hood having got on the track with his army.
Sherman saw after night, from a high point, the road burning for
miles.  The defence of the railroad by our troops was very
gallant, but they could not hold points between their intrenched
positions against Hood's whole army; in fact they made no attempt
to do so; but generally the intrenched positions were held, as
well as important bridges, and store located at them.
Allatoona, for instance, was defended by a small force of men
under the command of General Corse, one of the very able and
efficient volunteer officers produced by the war.  He, with a
small force, was cut off from the remainder of the National army
and was attacked with great vigor by many times his own number.
Sherman from his high position could see the battle raging, with
the Confederate troops between him and his subordinate.  He sent
men, of course, to raise the temporary siege, but the time that
would be necessarily consumed in reaching Corse, would be so
great that all occupying the intrenchments might be dead.  Corse
was a man who would never surrender.  From a high position some
of Sherman's signal corps discovered a signal flag waving from a
hole in the block house at Allatoona.  It was from Corse.  He had
been shot through the face, but he signalled to his chief a
message which left no doubt of his determination to hold his
post at all hazards.  It was at this point probably, that
Sherman first realized that with the forces at his disposal, the
keeping open of his line of communication with the North would be
impossible if he expected to retain any force with which to
operate offensively beyond Atlanta.  He proposed, therefore, to
destroy the roads back to Chattanooga, when all ready to move,
and leave the latter place garrisoned.  Yet, before abandoning
the railroad, it was necessary that he should repair damages
already done, and hold the road until he could get forward such
supplies, ordnance stores and small rations, as he wanted to
carry with him on his proposed march, and to return to the north
his surplus artillery; his object being to move light and to have
no more artillery than could be used to advantage on the field.</p>

<p>Sherman thought Hood would follow him, though he proposed to
prepare for the contingency of the latter moving the other way
while he was moving south, by making Thomas strong enough to
hold Tennessee and Kentucky.  I, myself, was thoroughly
satisfied that Hood would go north, as he did.  On the 2d of
November I telegraphed Sherman authorizing him definitely to
move according to the plan he had proposed:  that is, cutting
loose from his base, giving up Atlanta and the railroad back to
Chattanooga.  To strengthen Thomas he sent Stanley (4th corps)
back, and also ordered Schofield, commanding the Army of the
Ohio, twelve thousand strong, to report to him.  In addition to
this, A. J. Smith, who, with two divisions of Sherman's army,
was in Missouri aiding Rosecrans in driving the enemy from that
State, was under orders to return to Thomas and, under the most
unfavorable circumstances, might be expected to arrive there
long before Hood could reach Nashville.</p>

<p>In addition to this, the new levies of troops that were being
raised in the  North-west went to Thomas as rapidly as enrolled
and equipped.  Thomas, without any of these additions spoken of,
had a garrison at Chattanooga which had been strengthened by one
division and garrisons at Bridgeport, Stevenson, Decatur,
Murfreesboro, and Florence.  There were already with him in
Nashville ten thousand soldiers in round numbers, and many
thousands of employees in the quartermaster's and other
departments who could be put in the intrenchments in front of
Nashville, for its defence.  Also, Wilson was there with ten
thousand dismounted cavalrymen, who were being equipped for the
field.  Thomas had at this time about forty-five thousand men
without any of the reinforcements here above enumerated.  These
reinforcements gave him  altogether about seventy thousand men,
without counting what might be added by the new levies already
spoken of.</p>

<p>About this time Beauregard arrived upon the field, not to
supersede Hood in command, but to take general charge over the
entire district in which Hood and Sherman were, or might be,
operating.  He made the most frantic appeals to the citizens for
assistance to be rendered in every way:  by sending
reinforcements, by destroying supplies on the line of march of
the invaders, by destroying the bridges over which they would
have to cross, and by, in every way, obstructing the roads to
their front. But it was hard to convince the people of the
propriety of destroying supplies which were so much needed by
themselves, and each one hoped that his own possessions might
escape.</p>

<p>Hood soon started north, and went into camp near Decatur,
Alabama, where he remained until the 29th of October, but
without making an attack on the garrison of that place.</p>

<p>The Tennessee River was patrolled by gunboats, from Muscle
Shoals east; and, also, below the second shoals out to the Ohio
River.  These, with the troops that might be concentrated from
the garrisons along the river at any point where Hood might
choose to attempt to cross, made it impossible for him to cross
the Tennessee at any place where it was navigable.  But Muscle
Shoals is not navigable, and below them again is another shoal
which also obstructs navigation.  Hood therefore moved down to a
point nearly opposite Florence, Alabama, crossed over and
remained there for some time, collecting supplies of food,
forage and ammunition. All of these had to come from a
considerable distance south, because the region in which he was
then situated was mountainous, with small valleys which produced
but little, and what they had produced had long since been
exhausted.  On the 1st of November I suggested to Sherman, and
also asked his views thereon, the propriety of destroying Hood
before he started on his campaign.</p>

<p>On the 2d of November, as stated, I approved definitely his
making his proposed campaign through Georgia, leaving Hood
behind to the tender mercy of Thomas and the troops in his
command.  Sherman fixed the 10th of November as the day of
starting.</p>

<p>Sherman started on that day to get back to Atlanta, and on the
15th the real march to the sea commenced.  The right wing, under
Howard, and the cavalry went to Jonesboro, Milledgeville, then
the capital of Georgia, being Sherman's objective or stopping
place on the way to Savannah.  The left wing moved to Stone
Mountain, along roads much farther east than those taken by the
right wing. Slocum was in command, and threatened Augusta as the
point to which he was moving, but he was to turn off and meet the
right wing at Milledgeville.</p>

<br><br>

<p>Atlanta was destroyed so far as to render it worthless for
military purposes before starting, Sherman himself remaining
over a day to superintend the work, and see that it was well
done. Sherman's orders for this campaign were perfect.  Before
starting, he had sent back all sick, disabled and weak men,
retaining nothing but the hardy, well-inured soldiers to
accompany him on his long march in prospect.  His artillery was
reduced to sixty-five guns. The ammunition carried with them was
two hundred rounds for musket and gun.  Small rations were taken
in a small wagon train, which was loaded to its capacity for
rapid movement.  The army was expected to live on the country,
and to always keep the wagons full of forage and provisions
against a possible delay of a few days.</p>

<p>The troops, both of the right and left wings, made most of their
advance along the line of railroads, which they destroyed.  The
method adopted to perform this work, was to burn and destroy all
the bridges and culverts, and for a long distance, at places, to
tear up the track and bend the rails.  Soldiers to do this
rapidly would form a line along one side of the road with
crowbars and poles, place these under the rails and, hoisting
all at once, turn over many rods of road at one time.  The ties
would then be placed in piles, and the rails, as they were
loosened, would be carried and put across these log heaps.  When
a sufficient number of rails were placed upon a pile of ties it
would be set on fire.  This would heat the rails very much more
in the middle, that being over the main part of the fire, than
at the ends, so that they would naturally bend of their own
weight; but the soldiers, to increase the damage, would take
tongs and, one or two men at each end of the rail, carry it with
force against the nearest tree and twist it around, thus leaving
rails forming bands to ornament the forest trees of Georgia.
All this work was going on at the same time, there being a
sufficient number of men detailed for that purpose. Some piled
the logs and built the fire; some put the rails upon the fire;
while others would bend those that were sufficiently heated: so
that, by the time the last bit of road was torn up, that it was
designed to destroy at a certain place, the rails previously
taken up were already destroyed.</p>

<p>The organization for supplying the army was very complete.  Each
brigade furnished a company to gather supplies of forage and
provisions for the command to which they belonged.  Strict
injunctions were issued against pillaging, or otherwise
unnecessarily annoying the people; but everything in shape of
food for man and forage for beast was taken.  The supplies were
turned over to the brigade commissary and quartermaster, and
were issued by them to their respective commands precisely the
same as if they had been purchased.  The captures consisted
largely of cattle, sheep, poultry, some bacon, cornmeal, often
molasses, and occasionally coffee or other small rations.</p>

<p>The skill of these men, called by themselves and the army
"bummers," in collecting their loads and getting back to their
respective commands, was marvellous.  When they started out in
the morning, they were always on foot; but scarcely one of them
returned in the evening without being mounted on a horse or
mule. These would be turned in for the general use of the army,
and the next day these men would start out afoot and return
again in the evening mounted.</p>

<p>Many of the exploits of these men would fall under the head of
romance; indeed, I am afraid that in telling some of their
experiences, the romance got the better of the truth upon which
the story was founded, and that, in the way many of these
anecdotes are told, very little of the foundation is left.  I
suspect that most of them consist chiefly of the fiction added
to make the stories better.  In one instance it was reported
that a few men of Sherman's army passed a house where they
discovered some chickens under the dwelling.  They immediately
proceeded to capture them, to add to the army's supplies.  The
lady of the house, who happened to be at home, made piteous
appeals to have these spared, saying they were a few she had put
away to save by permission of other parties who had preceded and
who had taken all the others that she had.  The soldiers seemed
moved at her appeal; but looking at the chickens again they were
tempted and one of them replied:  "The rebellion must be
suppressed if it takes the last chicken in the Confederacy," and
proceeded to appropriate the last one.</p>

<p>Another anecdote characteristic of these times has been told.
The South, prior to the rebellion, kept bloodhounds to pursue
runaway slaves who took refuge in the neighboring swamps, and
also to hunt convicts.  Orders were issued to kill all these
animals as they were met with.  On one occasion a soldier picked
up a poodle, the favorite pet of its mistress, and was carrying
it off to execution when the lady made a strong appeal to him to
spare it. The soldier replied, "Madam, our orders are to kill
every bloodhound."  "But this is not a bloodhound," said the
lady.  "Well, madam, we cannot tell what it will grow into if we
leave it behind," said the soldier as he went off with it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these anecdotes, and the necessary hardship they
would seem to imply, I do not believe there was much
unwarrantable pillaging considering that we were in the enemy's
territory and without any supplies except such as the country
afforded.</p>

<p>On the 23d Sherman, with the left wing, reached Milledgeville.
The right wing was not far off:  but proceeded on its way
towards Savannah destroying the road as it went.  The troops at
Milledgeville remained over a day to destroy factories,
buildings used for military purposes, etc., before resuming its
march.</p>

<p>The governor, who had been almost defying Mr. Davis before this,
now fled precipitately, as did the legislature of the State and
all the State officers.  The governor, Sherman says, was careful
to carry away even his garden vegetables, while he left the
archives of the State to fall into our hands.  The only military
force that was opposed to Sherman's forward march was the Georgia
militia, a division under the command of General G. W. Smith, and
a battalion under Harry Wayne.  Neither the quality of the forces
nor their numbers was sufficient to even retard the progress of
Sherman's army.</p>

<p>The people at the South became so frantic at this time at the
successful invasion of Georgia that they took the cadets from
the military college and added them to the ranks of the
militia.  They even liberated the State convicts under promise
from them that they would serve in the army.  I have but little
doubt that the worst acts that were attributed to Sherman's army
were committed by these convicts, and by other Southern people
who ought to have been under sentence&mdash;such people as could be
found in every community, North and South&mdash;who took advantage of
their country being invaded to commit crime.  They were in but
little danger of detection, or of arrest even if detected.</p>

<p>The Southern papers in commenting upon Sherman's movements
pictured him as in the most deplorable condition:  stating that
his men were starving, that they were demoralized and wandering
about almost without object, aiming only to reach the sea coast
and get under the protection of our navy.  These papers got to
the North and had more or less effect upon the minds of the
people, causing much distress to all loyal persons particularly
to those who had husbands, sons or brothers with Sherman.  Mr.
Lincoln seeing these accounts, had a letter written asking me if
I could give him anything that he could say to the loyal people
that would comfort them.  I told him there was not the slightest
occasion for alarm; that with 60,000 such men as Sherman had with
him, such a commanding officer as he was could not be cut off in
the open country.  He might possibly be prevented from reaching
the point he had started out to reach, but he would get through
somewhere and would finally get to his chosen destination:  and
even if worst came to worst he could return North.  I heard
afterwards of Mr. Lincoln's saying, to those who would inquire
of him as to what he thought about the safety of Sherman's army,
that Sherman was all right:  "Grant says they are safe with such
a general, and that if they cannot get out where they want to,
they can crawl back by the hole they went in at."</p>

<p>While at Milledgeville the soldiers met at the State House,
organized a legislature, and proceeded to business precisely as
if they were the legislative body belonging to the State of
Georgia. The debates were exciting, and were upon the subject of
the situation the South was in at that time, particularly the
State of Georgia.  They went so far as to repeal, after a
spirited and acrimonious debate, the ordinance of secession.</p>

<p>The next day (24th) Sherman continued his march, going by the
way of Waynesboro and Louisville, Millen being the next
objective and where the two columns (the right and left wings)
were to meet.  The left wing moved to the left of the direct
road, and the cavalry still farther off so as to make it look as
though Augusta was the point they were aiming for.  They moved on
all the roads they could find leading in that direction.  The
cavalry was sent to make a rapid march in hope of surprising
Millen before the Union prisoners could be carried away; but
they failed in this.</p>

<p>The distance from Milledgeville to Millen was about one hundred
miles.  At this point Wheeler, who had been ordered from
Tennessee, arrived and swelled the numbers and efficiency of the
troops confronting Sherman.  Hardee, a native of Georgia, also
came, but brought no troops with him.  It was intended that he
should raise as large an army as possible with which to
intercept Sherman's march.  He did succeed in raising some
troops, and with these and those under the command of Wheeler
and Wayne, had an army sufficient to cause some annoyance but no
great detention. Our cavalry and Wheeler's had a pretty severe
engagement, in which Wheeler was driven towards Augusta, thus
giving the idea that Sherman was probably making for that point.</p>

<p>Millen was reached on the 3d of December, and the march was
resumed the following day for Savannah, the final objective.
Bragg had now been sent to Augusta with some troops.  Wade
Hampton was there also trying to raise cavalry sufficient to
destroy Sherman's army.  If he ever raised a force it was too
late to do the work expected of it.  Hardee's whole force
probably numbered less than ten thousand men.</p>

<p>From Millen to Savannah the country is sandy and poor, and
affords but very little forage other than rice straw, which was
then growing.  This answered a very good purpose as forage, and
the rice grain was an addition to the soldier's rations.  No
further resistance worthy of note was met with, until within a
few miles of Savannah.  This place was found to be intrenched
and garrisoned.  Sherman proceeded at once on his arrival to
invest the place, and found that the enemy had placed torpedoes
in the ground, which were to explode when stepped on by man or
beast. One of these exploded under an officer's horse, blowing
the animal to pieces and tearing one of the legs of the officer
so badly that it had to be amputated.  Sherman at once ordered
his prisoners to the front, moving them in a compact body in
advance, to either explode the torpedoes or dig them up.  No
further explosion took place.</p>

<p>On the 10th of December the siege of Savannah commenced. Sherman
then, before proceeding any further with operations for the
capture of the place, started with some troops to open
communication with our fleet, which he expected to find in the
lower harbor or as near by as the forts of the enemy would
permit. In marching to the coast he encountered Fort McAllister,
which it was necessary to reduce before the supplies he might
find on shipboard could be made available.  Fort McAllister was
soon captured by an assault made by General Hazen's division.
Communication was then established with the fleet.  The capture
of Savannah then only occupied a few days, and involved no great
loss of life.  The garrison, however, as we shall see, was
enabled to escape by crossing the river and moving eastward.</p>

<p>When Sherman had opened communication with the fleet he found
there a steamer, which I had forwarded to him, carrying the
accumulated mails for his army, also supplies which I supposed
he would be in need of.  General J. G. Foster, who commanded all
the troops south of North Carolina on the Atlantic sea-board,
visited General Sherman before he had opened communication with
the fleet, with the view of ascertaining what assistance he
could be to him.  Foster returned immediately to his own
headquarters at Hilton Head, for the purpose of sending Sherman
siege guns, and also if he should find he had them to spare,
supplies of clothing, hard bread, etc., thinking that these
articles might not be found outside.  The mail on the steamer
which I sent down, had been collected by Colonel A. H. Markland
of the Post Office Department, who went in charge of it.  On
this same vessel I sent an officer of my staff (Lieutenant Dunn)
with the following letter to General Sherman:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
<br>CITY POINT, VA., Dec. 3, 1864.</p>

<p>MAJOR-GENERAL W. T.  SHERMAN,
<br>Commanding Armies near Savannah, Ga.</p>

<p>The little information gleaned from the Southern press,
indicating no great obstacle to your progress, I have directed
your mails (which had been previously collected at Baltimore by
Colonel Markland, Special Agent of the Post Office Department)
to be sent as far as the blockading squadron off Savannah, to be
forwarded to you as soon as heard from on the coast.</p>

<p>Not liking to rejoice before the victory is assured, I abstain
from congratulating you and those under your command, until
bottom has been struck.  I have never had a fear, however, for
the result.</p>

<p>Since you left Atlanta, no very great progress has been made
here. The enemy has been closely watched though, and prevented
from detaching against you.  I think not one man has gone from
here, except some twelve or fifteen hundred dismounted
cavalry.  Bragg has gone from Wilmington.  I am trying to take
advantage of his absence to get possession of that place.  Owing
to some preparations Admiral Porter and General Butler are making
to blow up Fort Fisher (which, while hoping for the best, I do
not believe a particle in), there is a delay in getting this
expedition off.  I hope they will be ready to start by the 7th,
and that Bragg will not have started back by that time.</p>

<p>In this letter I do not intend to give you anything like
directions for future action, but will state a general idea I
have, and will get your views after you have established
yourself on the sea-coast. With your veteran army I hope to get
control of the only two through routes from east to west
possessed by the enemy before the fall of Atlanta.  The
condition will be filled by holding Savannah and Augusta, or by
holding any other port to the east of Savannah and
Branchville.  If Wilmington falls, a force from there can
co-operate with you.</p>

<p>Thomas has got back into the defences of Nashville, with Hood
close upon him.  Decatur has been abandoned, and so have all the
roads except the main one leading to Chattanooga.  Part of this
falling back was undoubtedly necessary and all of it may have
been.  It did not look so, however, to me.  In my opinion,
Thomas far outnumbers Hood in infantry.  In cavalry, Hood has
the advantage in morale and numbers.  I hope yet that Hood will
be badly crippled if not destroyed.  The general news you will
learn from the papers better than I could give it.</p>

<p>After all becomes quiet, and roads become so bad up here that
there is likely to be a week or two when nothing can be done, I
will run down the coast to see you.  If you desire it, I will
ask Mrs. Sherman to go with me.</p>

<p>Yours truly,
<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
I quote this letter because it gives the reader a full knowledge
of the events of that period.</p>

<p>Sherman now (the 15th) returned to Savannah to complete its
investment and insure the surrender of the garrison.  The
country about Savannah is low and marshy, and the city was well
intrenched from the river above to the river below; and assaults
could not be made except along a comparatively narrow causeway.
For this reason assaults must have resulted in serious
destruction of life to the Union troops, with the chance of
failing altogether. Sherman therefore decided upon a complete
investment of the place.  When he believed this investment
completed, he summoned the garrison to surrender.  General
Hardee, who was in command, replied in substance that the
condition of affairs was not such as Sherman had described.  He
said he was in full communication with his department and was
receiving supplies constantly.</p>

<p>Hardee, however, was cut off entirely from all communication
with the west side of the river, and by the river itself to the
north and south.  On the South Carolina side the country was all
rice fields, through which it would have been impossible to bring
supplies so that Hardee had no possible communication with the
outside world except by a dilapidated plank road starting from
the west bank of the river.  Sherman, receiving this reply,
proceeded in person to a point on the coast, where General
Foster had troops stationed under General Hatch, for the purpose
of making arrangements with the latter officer to go through by
one of the numerous channels running inland along that part of
the coast of South Carolina, to the plank road which General
Hardee still possessed, and thus to cut him off from the last
means he had of getting supplies, if not of communication.</p>

<p>While arranging for this movement, and before the attempt to
execute the plan had been commenced, Sherman received
information through one of his staff officers that the enemy had
evacuated Savannah the night before.  This was the night of the
21st of December.  Before evacuating the place Hardee had blown
up the navy yard.  Some iron-clads had been destroyed, as well
as other property that might have been valuable to us; but he
left an immense amount of stores untouched, consisting of
cotton, railroad cars, workshops, numerous pieces of artillery,
and several thousand stands of small arms.</p>

<p>A little incident occurred, soon after the fall of Savannah,
which Sherman relates in his Memoirs, and which is worthy of
repetition. Savannah was one of the points where blockade
runners entered. Shortly after the city fell into our
possession, a blockade runner came sailing up serenely, not
doubting but the Confederates were still in possession.  It was
not molested, and the captain did not find out his mistake until
he had tied up and gone to the Custom House, where he found a new
occupant of the building, and made a less profitable disposition
of his vessel and cargo than he had expected.</p>

<p>As there was some discussion as to the authorship of Sherman's
march to the sea, by critics of his book when it appeared before
the public, I want to state here that no question upon that
subject was ever raised between General Sherman and myself.
Circumstances made the plan on which Sherman expected to act
impracticable, as as commander of the forces he necessarily had
to devise a new on which would give more promise of success:
consequently he recommended the destruction of the railroad back
to Chattanooga, and that he should be authorized then to move, as
he did, from Atlanta forward.  His suggestions were finally
approved, although they did not immediately find favor in
Washington.  Even when it came to the time of starting, the
greatest apprehension, as to the propriety of the campaign he
was about commence, filled the mind of the President, induced no
doubt by his advisers.  This went so far as to  move the
President to ask me to suspend Sherman's march for a day or two
until I could think the matter over.  My recollection is, though
I find no record to show it, that out of deference to the
President's wish I did send a dispatch to Sherman asking him to
wait a day or two, or else the connections between us were
already cut so that I could not do so.  However this may be, the
question of who devised the plan of march from Atlanta to
Savannah is easily answered:  it was clearly Sherman, and to him
also belongs the credit of its brilliant execution.  It was
hardly possible that any one else than those on the spot could
have devised a new plan of campaign to supersede one that did
not promise success. [See Appendix, letters of Oct. 11th.]</p>

<p>I was in favor of Sherman's plan from the time it was first
submitted to me.  My chief of staff, however, was very bitterly
opposed to it and, as I learned subsequently, finding that he
could not move me, he appealed to the authorities at Washington
to stop it.</p>



<br><br><br><br>
<a name="ch60"></a><center><h2>CHAPTER LX.</h2></center>

<center><h3>THE BATTLE OF FRANKLIN&mdash;THE BATTLE OF NASHVILLE.</h3></center>
<br>

<p>As we have seen, Hood succeeded in crossing the Tennessee River
between Muscle Shoals and the lower shoals at the end of
October, 1864.  Thomas sent Schofield with the 4th and 23d
corps, together with three brigades of Wilson's cavalry to
Pulaski to watch him.  On the 17th of November Hood started and
moved in such a manner as to avoid Schofield, thereby turning
his position.  Hood had with him three infantry corps, commanded
respectively by Stephen D. Lee, Stewart and Cheatham.  These,
with his cavalry, numbered about forty-five thousand men.
Schofield had, of all arms, about thirty thousand.  Thomas's
orders were, therefore, for Schofield to watch the movements of
the enemy, but not to fight a battle if he could avoid it; but
to fall back in case of an advance on Nashville, and to fight
the enemy, as he fell back, so as to retard the enemy's
movements until he could be reinforced by Thomas himself.  As
soon as Schofield saw this movement of Hood's, he sent his
trains to the rear, but did not fall back himself until the
21st, and then only to Columbia.  At Columbia there was a slight
skirmish but no battle.  From this place Schofield then retreated
to Franklin.  He had sent his wagons in advance, and Stanley had
gone with them with two divisions to protect them.  Cheatham's
corps of Hood's army pursued the wagon train and went into camp
at Spring Hill, for the night of the 29th.</p>

<p>Schofield retreating from Columbia on the 29th, passed Spring
Hill, where Cheatham was bivouacked, during the night without
molestation, though within half a mile of where the Confederates
were encamped.  On the morning of the 30th he had arrived at
Franklin.</p>

<p>Hood followed closely and reached Franklin in time to make an
attack the same day.  The fight was very desperate and
sanguinary.  The Confederate generals led their men in the
repeated charges, and the loss among them was of unusual
proportions.  This fighting continued with great severity until
long after the night closed in, when the Confederates drew
off.  General Stanley, who commanded two divisions of the Union
troops, and whose troops bore the brunt of the battle, was
wounded in the fight, but maintained his position.</p>

<p>The enemy's loss at Franklin, according to Thomas's report, was
1,750 buried upon the field by our troops, 3,800 in the
hospital, and 702 prisoners besides.  Schofield's loss, as
officially reported, was 189 killed, 1,033 wounded, and 1,104
captured and missing.</p>

<p>Thomas made no effort to reinforce Schofield at Franklin, as it
seemed to me at the time he should have done, and fight out the
battle there.  He simply ordered Schofield to continue his
retreat to Nashville, which the latter did during that night and
the next day.</p>

<p>Thomas, in the meantime, was making his preparations to receive
Hood.  The road to Chattanooga was still well guarded with
strong garrisons at Murfreesboro, Stevenson, Bridgeport and
Chattanooga.  Thomas had previously given up Decatur and had
been reinforced by A. J. Smith's two divisions just returned
from Missouri.  He also had Steedman's division and R. S.
Granger's, which he had drawn from the front.  His
quartermaster's men, about ten thousand in number, had been
organized and armed under the command of the chief
quartermaster, General J. L. Donaldson, and placed in the
fortifications under the general supervision of General Z. B.
Tower, of the United States Engineers.</p>

<p>Hood was allowed to move upon Nashville, and to invest that
place almost without interference.  Thomas was strongly
fortified in his position, so that he would have been safe
against the attack of Hood.  He had troops enough even to
annihilate him in the open field.  To me his delay was
unaccountable&mdash;sitting there and permitting himself to be
invested, so that, in the end, to raise the siege he would have
to fight the enemy strongly posted behind fortifications.  It is
true the weather was very bad.  The rain was falling and freezing
as it fell, so that the ground was covered with a sheet of ice,
that made it very difficult to move.  But I was afraid that the
enemy would find means of moving, elude Thomas and manage to get
north of the Cumberland River.  If he did this, I apprehended
most serious results from the campaign in the North, and was
afraid we might even have to send troops from the East to head
him off if he got there, General Thomas's movements being always
so deliberate and so slow, though effective in defence.</p>

</center>
<br><br>
<br><br>

<p>I consequently urged Thomas in frequent dispatches sent from
City Point to make the attack at once.  The country was
alarmed, the administration was alarmed, and I was alarmed lest
the very thing would take place which I have just described that
is, Hood would get north.  It was all without avail further than
to elicit dispatches from Thomas saying that he was getting
ready to move as soon as he could, that he was making
preparations, etc.  At last I had to say to General Thomas that
I should be obliged to remove him unless he acted promptly.  He
replied that he was very sorry, but he would move as soon as he
could.</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<br>
CITY POINT, VA., December 2,1864.
<br>
<br><br>MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS,
<br>Nashville Tenn.

<br><br>If Hood is permitted to remain quietly about Nashville, you will
lose all the road back to Chattanooga and possibly have to
abandon the line of the Tennessee.  Should he attack you it is
all well, but if he does not you should attack him before he
fortifies.  Arm and put in the trenches your quartermaster
employees, citizens, etc.

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.

<br><br><br>
<br>CITY POINT, VA., December 2, 1864.&mdash;1.30 P.M.

<br><br>MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS,
<br>Nashville, Tenn.

<br><br>With your citizen employees armed, you can move out of Nashville
with all your army and force the enemy to retire or fight upon
ground of your own choosing.  After the repulse of Hood at
Franklin, it looks to me that instead of falling back to
Nashville we should have taken the offensive against the enemy
where he was.  At this distance, however, I may err as to the
best method of dealing with the enemy.  You will now suffer
incalculable injury upon your railroads if Hood is not speedily
disposed of.  Put forth therefore every possible exertion to
attain this end.  Should you get him to retreating give him no
peace.

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.

<br><br><br>

<br>CITY POINT, VA., December 5, 1864.
<br>
<br>MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS,
<br>Nashville, Tenn.

<br><br>Is there not danger of Forrest moving down the Cumberland to
where he can cross it?  It seems to me whilst you should be
getting up your cavalry as rapidly as possible to look after
Forrest, Hood should be attacked where he is.  Time strengthens
him in all possibility as much as it does you.

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.

<br><br><br>
<br>CITY POINT, VA., December 6, 1864&mdash;4 P.M.

<br><br>MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS,
<br>Nashville, Tenn.

<br><br>Attack Hood at once and wait no longer for a remnant of your
cavalry.  There is great danger of delay resulting in a campaign
back to the Ohio River.

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.

<br><br><br><br>
CITY POINT, VA., December 8, 1864.&mdash;8.30 P.M.

<br><br>MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS,
<br>Nashville, Tenn.

<br><br>Your dispatch of yesterday received.  It looks to me evident the
enemy are trying to cross the Cumberland River, and are
scattered.  Why not attack at once?  By all means avoid the
contingency of a foot race to see which, you or Hood, can beat
to the Ohio.  If you think necessary call on the governors of
States to send a force into Louisville to meet the enemy if he
should cross the river.  You clearly never should cross except
in rear of the enemy.  Now is one of the finest opportunities
ever presented of destroying one of the three armies of the
enemy.  If destroyed he never can replace it.  Use the means at
your command, and you can do this and cause a rejoicing that
will resound from one end of the land to the other.

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.

<br><br><br><br>
CITY POINT, VA., December 11, 1864.&mdash;4 P.M.

<br><br>MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS,
<br>Nashville, Tenn.

<br><br>If you delay attack longer the mortifying spectacle will be
witnessed of a rebel army moving for the Ohio River, and you
will be forced to act, accepting such weather as you find.  Let
there be no further delay.  Hood cannot even stand a drawn
battle so far from his supplies of ordnance stores.  If he
retreats and you follow, he must lose his material and much of
his army.  I am in hopes of receiving a dispatch from you to-day
announcing that you have moved.  Delay no longer for weather or
reinforcements.

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.

<br><br><br><br>
WASHINGTON, D. C., December 15, 1864.

<br><br>MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS,
Nashville, Tenn.

<br><br>I was just on my way to Nashville, but receiving a dispatch from
Van Duzer detailing your splendid success of to-day, I shall go
no further.  Push the enemy now and give him no rest until he is
entirely destroyed.  Your army will cheerfully suffer many
privations to break up Hood's army and render it useless for
future operations.  Do not stop for trains or supplies, but take
them from the country as the enemy have done.  Much is now
expected.

<br><br>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.
</blockquote></blockquote>


<p>General Logan happening to visit City Point about that time, and
knowing him as a prompt, gallant and efficient officer, I gave
him an order to proceed to Nashville to relieve Thomas.  I
directed him, however, not to deliver the order or publish it
until he reached there, and if Thomas had moved, then not to
deliver it at all, but communicate with me by telegraph.  After
Logan started, in thinking over the situation, I became
restless, and concluded to go myself.  I went as far as
Washington City, when a dispatch was received from General
Thomas announcing his readiness at last to move, and designating
the time of his movement.  I concluded to wait until that time.
He did move, and was successful from the start.  This was on the
15th of December.  General Logan was at Louisville at the time
this movement was made, and telegraphed the fact to Washington,
and proceeded no farther himself.</p>

<p>The battle during the 15th was severe, but favorable to the
Union troops, and continued until night closed in upon the
combat.  The next day the battle was renewed.  After a
successful assault upon Hood's men in their intrenchments the
enemy fled in disorder, routed and broken, leaving their dead,
their artillery and small arms in great numbers on the field,
besides the wounded that were captured.  Our cavalry had fought
on foot as infantry, and had not their horses with them; so that
they were not ready to join in the pursuit the moment the enemy
retreated.  They sent back, however, for their horses, and
endeavored to get to Franklin ahead of Hood's broken army by the
Granny White Road, but too much time was consumed in getting
started.  They had got but a few miles beyond the scene of the
battle when they found the enemy's cavalry dismounted and behind
intrenchments covering the road on which they were advancing.
Here another battle ensued, our men dismounting and fighting on
foot, in which the Confederates were again routed and driven in
great disorder.  Our cavalry then went into bivouac, and renewed
the pursuit on the following morning.  They were too late.  The
enemy already had possession of Franklin, and was beyond them.
It now became a chase in which the Confederates had the lead.</p>

<p>Our troops continued the pursuit to within a few miles of
Columbia, where they found the rebels had destroyed the railroad
bridge as well as all other bridges over Duck River.  The heavy
rains of a few days before had swelled the stream into a mad
torrent, impassable except on bridges.  Unfortunately, either
through a mistake in the wording of the order or otherwise, the
pontoon bridge which was to have been sent by rail out to
Franklin, to be taken thence with the pursuing column, had gone
toward Chattanooga.  There was, consequently, a delay of some
four days in building bridges out of the remains of the old
railroad bridge.  Of course Hood got such a start in this time
that farther pursuit was useless, although it was continued for
some distance, but without coming upon him again.</p>

<center><h3>EXPEDITION AGAINST FORT FISHER&mdash;ATTACK ON THE FORT&mdash;FAILURE OF
THE EXPEDITION&mdash;SECOND EXPEDITION AGAINST THE FORT&mdash;CAPTURE OF
FORT FISHER.</h3></center>
<br>

<p>Up to January, 1865, the enemy occupied Fort Fisher, at the
mouth of Cape Fear River and below the City of Wilmington.  This
port was of immense importance to the Confederates, because it
formed their principal inlet for blockade runners by means of
which they brought in from abroad such supplies and munitions of
war as they could not produce at home.  It was equally important
to us to get possession of it, not only because it was desirable
to cut off their supplies so as to insure a speedy termination of
the war, but also because foreign governments, particularly the
British Government, were constantly threatening that unless ours
could maintain the blockade of that coast they should cease to
recognize any blockade.  For these reasons I determined, with
the concurrence of the Navy Department, in December, to send an
expedition against Fort Fisher for the purpose of capturing it.</p>

<p>To show the difficulty experienced in maintaining the blockade,
I will mention a circumstance that took place at Fort Fisher
after its fall.  Two English blockade runners came in at
night.  Their commanders, not supposing the fort had fallen,
worked their way through all our fleet and got into the river
unobserved.  They then signalled the fort, announcing their
arrival.  There was a colored man in the fort who had been there
before and who understood these signals.  He informed General
Terry what reply he should make to have them come in, and Terry
did as he advised.  The vessels came in, their officers entirely
unconscious that they were falling into the hands of the Union
forces.  Even after they were brought in to the fort they were
entertained in conversation for some little time before
suspecting that the Union troops were occupying the fort.  They
were finally informed that their vessels and cargoes were prizes.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<center><a name="b389"></a><img alt="b389.jpg (76K)" src="images/b389.jpg" height="943" width="633">
</center>
<br><br>
<br><br>

<p>I selected General Weitzel, of the Army of the James, to go with
the expedition, but gave instructions through General Butler.  He
commanded the department within whose geographical limits Fort
Fisher was situated, as well as Beaufort and other points on
that coast held by our troops; he was, therefore, entitled to
the right of fitting out the expedition against Fort Fisher.</p>

<p>General Butler conceived the idea that if a steamer loaded
heavily with powder could be run up to near the shore under the
fort and exploded, it would create great havoc and make the
capture an easy matter.  Admiral Porter, who was to command the
naval squadron, seemed to fall in with the idea, and it was not
disapproved of in Washington; the navy was therefore given the
task of preparing the steamer for this purpose.  I had no
confidence in the success of the scheme, and so expressed
myself; but as no serious harm could come of the experiment, and
the authorities at Washington seemed desirous to have it tried, I
permitted it.  The steamer was sent to Beaufort, North Carolina,
and was there loaded with powder and prepared for the part she
was to play in the reduction of Fort Fisher.</p>

<p>General Butler chose to go in command of the expedition himself,
and was all ready to sail by the 9th of December (1864).  Very
heavy storms prevailed, however, at that time along that part of
the sea-coast, and prevented him from getting off until the 13th
or 14th.  His advance arrived off Fort Fisher on the 15th.  The
naval force had been already assembled, or was assembling, but
they were obliged to run into Beaufort for munitions, coal,
etc.; then, too, the powder-boat was not yet fully prepared. The
fleet was ready to proceed on the 18th; but Butler, who had
remained outside from the 15th up to that time, now found
himself out of coal, fresh water, etc., and had to put into
Beaufort to replenish.  Another storm overtook him, and several
days more were lost before the army and navy were both ready at
the same time to co-operate.</p>

<p>On the night of the 23d the powder-boat was towed in by a
gunboat as near to the fort as it was safe to run.  She was then
propelled by her own machinery to within about five hundred yards
of the shore.  There the clockwork, which was to explode her
within a certain length of time, was set and she was
abandoned.  Everybody left, and even the vessels put out to sea
to prevent the effect of the explosion upon them.  At two
o'clock in the morning the explosion took place&mdash;and produced no
more effect on the fort, or anything else on land, than the
bursting of a boiler anywhere on the Atlantic Ocean would have
done.  Indeed when the troops in Fort Fisher heard the explosion
they supposed it was the bursting of a boiler in one of the
Yankee gunboats.</p>

<p>Fort Fisher was situated upon a low, flat peninsula north of
Cape Fear River.  The soil is sandy.  Back a little the
peninsula is very heavily wooded, and covered with fresh-water
swamps.  The fort ran across this peninsula, about five hundred
yards in width, and extended along the sea coast about thirteen
hundred yards.  The fort had an armament of 21 guns and 3
mortars on the land side, and 24 guns on the sea front.  At that
time it was only garrisoned by four companies of infantry, one
light battery and the gunners at the heavy guns less than seven
hundred men with a reserve of less than a thousand men five
miles up the peninsula.  General Whiting of the Confederate army
was in command, and General Bragg was in command of the force at
Wilmington.  Both commenced calling for reinforcements the
moment they saw our troops landing.  The Governor of North
Carolina called for everybody who could stand behind a parapet
and shoot a gun, to join them.  In this way they got two or
three hundred additional men into Fort Fisher; and Hoke's
division, five or six thousand strong, was sent down from
Richmond.  A few of these troops arrived the very day that
Butler was ready to advance.</p>

<p>On the 24th the fleet formed for an attack in arcs of concentric
circles, their heavy iron-clads going in very close range, being
nearest the shore, and leaving intervals or spaces so that the
outer vessels could fire between them.  Porter was thus enabled
to throw one hundred and fifteen shells per minute.  The damage
done to the fort by these shells was very slight, only two or
three cannon being disabled in the fort.  But the firing
silenced all the guns by making it too hot for the men to
maintain their positions about them and compelling them to seek
shelter in the bomb-proofs.</p>

<p>On the next day part of Butler's troops under General Adelbert
Ames effected a landing out of range of the fort without
difficulty.  This was accomplished under the protection of
gunboats sent for the purpose, and under cover of a renewed
attack upon the fort by the fleet.  They formed a line across
the peninsula and advanced, part going north and part toward the
fort, covering themselves as they did so.  Curtis pushed forward
and came near to Fort Fisher, capturing the small garrison at
what was called the Flag Pond Battery.  Weitzel accompanied him
to within a half a mile of the works.  Here he saw that the fort
had not been injured, and so reported to Butler, advising against
an assault.  Ames, who had gone north in his advance, captured
228 of the reserves.  These prisoners reported to Butler that
sixteen hundred of Hoke's division of six thousand from Richmond
had already arrived and the rest would soon be in his rear.</p>

<p>Upon these reports Butler determined to withdraw his troops from
the peninsula and return to the fleet.  At that time there had
not been a man on our side injured except by one of the shells
from the fleet.  Curtis had got within a few yards of the
works.  Some of his men had snatched a flag from the parapet of
the fort, and others had taken a horse from the inside of the
stockade.  At night Butler informed Porter of his withdrawal,
giving the reasons above stated, and announced his purpose as
soon as his men could embark to start for Hampton Roads.  Porter
represented to him that he had sent to Beaufort for more
ammunition.  He could fire much faster than he had been doing,
and would keep the enemy from showing himself until our men were
within twenty yards of the fort, and he begged that Butler would
leave some brave fellows like those who had snatched the flag
from the parapet and taken the horse from the fort.</p>

<p>Butler was unchangeable.  He got all his troops aboard, except
Curtis's brigade, and started back.  In doing this, Butler made
a fearful mistake.  My instructions to him, or to the officer
who went in command of the expedition, were explicit in the
statement that to effect a landing would be of itself a great
victory, and if one should be effected, the foothold must not be
relinquished; on the contrary, a regular siege of the fort must
be commenced and, to guard against interference by reason of
storms, supplies of provisions must be laid in as soon as they
could be got on shore.  But General Butler seems to have lost
sight of this part of his instructions, and was back at Fort
Monroe on the 28th.</p>

<p>I telegraphed to the President as follows:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
CITY POINT, VA.,
<br>Dec. 28, 1864.&mdash;8.30 P.M.</p>

<p>The Wilmington expedition has proven a gross and culpable
failure.  Many of the troops are back here.  Delays and free
talk of the object of the expedition enabled the enemy to move
troops to Wilmington to defeat it.  After the expedition sailed
from Fort Monroe, three days of fine weather were squandered,
during which the enemy was without a force to protect himself.
Who is to blame will, I hope, be known.</p>

<p>U. S. GRANT,
<br>Lieutenant-General.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
Porter sent dispatches to the Navy Department in which he
complained bitterly of having been abandoned by the army just
when the fort was nearly in our possession, and begged that our
troops might be sent back again to cooperate, but with a
different commander.  As soon as I heard this I sent a messenger
to Porter with a letter asking him to hold on.  I assured him
that I fully sympathized with him in his disappointment, and
that I would send the same troops back with a different
commander, with some reinforcements to offset those which the
enemy had received.  I told him it would take some little time
to get transportation for the additional troops; but as soon as
it could be had the men should be on their way to him, and there
would be no delay on my part.  I selected A. H. Terry to command.</p>

<p>It was the 6th of January before the transports could be got
ready and the troops aboard.  They sailed from Fortress Monroe
on that day.  The object and destination of the second
expedition were at the time kept a secret to all except a few in
the Navy Department and in the army to whom it was necessary to
impart the information.  General Terry had not the slightest
idea of where he was going or what he was to do.  He simply knew
that he was going to sea and that he had his orders with him,
which were to be opened when out at sea.</p>

<p>He was instructed to communicate freely with Porter and have
entire harmony between army and navy, because the work before
them would require the best efforts of both arms of service.
They arrived off Beaufort on the 8th. A heavy storm, however,
prevented a landing at Forth Fisher until the 13th.  The navy
prepared itself for attack about as before, and the same time
assisted the army in landing, this time five miles away.  Only
iron-clads fired at first; the object being to draw the fire of
the enemy's guns so as to ascertain their positions. This object
being accomplished, they then let in their shots thick and
fast.  Very soon the guns were all silenced, and the fort showed
evident signs of being much injured.</p>

<p>Terry deployed his men across the peninsula as had been done
before, and at two o'clock on the following morning was up
within two miles of the fort with a respectable abatis in front
of his line. His artillery was all landed on that day, the
14th.  Again Curtis's brigade of Ame's division had the lead. By
noon they had carried an unfinished work less than a half mile
from the fort, and turned it so as to face the other way.</p>

<p>Terry now saw Porter and arranged for an assault on the
following day.  The two commanders arranged their signals so
that they could communicate with each other from time to time as
they might have occasion.  At day light the fleet commenced its
firing.  The time agreed upon for the assault was the middle of
the afternoon, and Ames who commanded the assaulting column
moved at 3.30.  Porter landed a force of sailors and marines to
move against the sea-front in co-operation with Ames's
assault.  They were under Commander Breese of the navy.  These
sailors and marines had worked their way up to within a couple
of hundred yards of the fort before the assault.  The signal was
given and the assault was made; but the poor sailors and marines
were repulsed and very badly handled by the enemy, losing 280
killed and wounded out of their number.</p>

<p>Curtis's brigade charged successfully though met by a heavy
fire, some of the men having to wade through the swamp up to
their waists to reach the fort.  Many were wounded, of course,
and some killed; but they soon reached the palisades.  These
they cut away, and pushed on through.  The other troops then
came up, Pennypacker's following Curtis, and Bell, who commanded
the 3d brigade of Ames's division, following Pennypacker.  But
the fort was not yet captured though the parapet was gained.</p>

<p>The works were very extensive.  The large parapet around the
work would have been but very little protection to those inside
except when they were close up under it.  Traverses had,
therefore, been run until really the work was a succession of
small forts enclosed by a large one.  The rebels made a
desperate effort to hold the fort, and had to be driven from
these traverses one by one.  The fight continued till long after
night.  Our troops gained first one traverse and then another,
and by 10 o'clock at night the place was carried.  During this
engagement the sailors, who had been repulsed in their assault
on the bastion, rendered the best service they could by
reinforcing Terry's northern line&mdash;thus enabling him to send a
detachment to the assistance of Ames.  The fleet kept up a
continuous fire upon that part of the fort which was still
occupied by the enemy.  By means of signals they could be
informed where to direct their shots.</p>

<p>During the succeeding nights the enemy blew up Fort Caswell on
the opposite side of Cape Fear River, and abandoned two
extensive works on Smith's Island in the river.</p>

<p>Our captures in all amounted to 169 guns, besides small-arms,
with full supplies of ammunition, and 2,083 prisoners.  In
addition to these, there were about 700 dead and wounded left
there.  We had lost 110 killed and 536 wounded.</p>

<p>In this assault on Fort Fisher, Bell, one of the brigade
commanders, was killed, and two, Curtis and Pennypacker, were
badly wounded.</p>

<p>Secretary Stanton, who was on his way back from Savannah,
arrived off Fort Fisher soon after it fell.  When he heard the
good news he promoted all the officers of any considerable rank
for their conspicuous gallantry.  Terry had been nominated for
major-general, but had not been confirmed.  This confirmed him;
and soon after I recommended him for a brigadier-generalcy in
the regular army, and it was given to him for this victory.</p>
